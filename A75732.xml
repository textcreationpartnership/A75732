            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>COnſidering it is the duty of all that love the truth to bear witneſs thereunto, every one according to the grace received; and this being an age wherein the Kingly power of Christ is much controverted, I thought it my duty to caſt in my mite, and to contribute what the Lord hath imparted to me, for the publick good. Which conſideration hath moved me to publiſh this ſmall treatiſe, and to expoſe it unto the view of others, that they may weigh and conſider the matter-ſubject thereof. Wherein I have indeavoured with as much bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and evidence of truth as I could, to vindicate the Soveraign power of the Lord Jeſus, as well intemporal as ſpiritual matters. In order whereunto, I thought it meet to open this portion of Scripture in Iſaiah, which doth ſo expreſly ſpeak of that ſubject. And though I cannot appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that all men, no nor all the Saints and faithful Servants of Chriſt, will aſſent unto every <hi>Iota;</hi> yet I doubt not but they will allow unto me, as I alſo account it may duly to allow unto them, a latitude; Not thinking it meet to lye up all mens Judgements in every ſcruple, to be of the ſame mind. However, I am confident of this, that ſo far as they ſee any light of truth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, they will be of the ſame mind, and that is all I do deſire, leaving each one to the liberty of their Judgements, until fuller light break forth. And let me requeſt this, that none may take occaſion of ſtumbling, becauſe in ſome paſſage I ſay, that we find no mention of Juries in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it having been an ancient received cuſtome in <hi>England,</hi> and, as many apprehend it to be, a matter of great priviledge to the conſervation of the ſubjects liberty and free paſſage of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. For if it may be granted, that theſe <hi>Jurors</hi> are indeed Judges of the cauſes brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and be men qualifyed and choſen according to the Rule, and be obliged to give in their Verdicts and Judgements according to the perfect rule of the Word of Truth; and that in every circuit, whether town, hundred, or ſhire, ſuch known fit perſons may be conſtituted, I diſallow it not: it is not the name I take offence at, for I would not ſtrive about words, though it were deſireable we might in our words and ſpeeches learn to ſpeak the language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> I mean Scripture-language.</p>
            <p>And though I moſtly inſiſt upon the Judicials of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as the Rules of Judgement in all caſes, Capital, Criminal, or Civil; yet my intention is not to bind up all Rules of Judgement, in every caſe, to that ſcantling, but withal to take in the whole Scriptures of the Prophets and Apoſtles, which do give light and direction to the right underſtanding and application of thoſe rules, unto each particular caſe. For my intention is not in this ſmall tractate to Judaize, but to ſhew the perfection of the whole Word of God, to direct in matters of Civil Judgements, as well as in Church affairs. And if I ſometimes rebuke ſharply, and blame the uſurping power of Princes and States, in aſſuming the Royal Prerogative of giving Laws unto the people, without Commiſſion from Chriſt; you may bear with me, for they are worthy to be reproved. It is not want of due reſpect to Magiſtrates that maketh me ſo bold, but my faithfulneſs and love to them moves me to advertiſe them of the danger. I deſcend not to a particular application of thoſe obliquities I touch upon, unto any particular perſons or ſtates, becauſe I ſee not a cleer ground to carry me forth therein, except they ſhould require it at my hands. It ſufficeth me to ſhew them the truth, and leave it to themſelves to make application, and to all the Saints to be judges, who ſhall in <hi>fine</hi> judge all the World. I ſhould have rejoyced that ſome more able
<pb facs="tcp:117430:3"/> would have undertook this taske. But when I perceived a deep ſilence (I mean as to willing) and many cryed out againſt <hi>fifth Monarchy</hi> men, as they are called, that they make a great noiſe and clamour againſt this and that Government, and know not what Government they would have, or at leaſt do not publiſh it to the World, I thought it a duly incumbent upon me, to remove that Calumnie, by holding forth the most perfect rule and platform of all adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians in civil States. If yet it be ſaid, that I have not digeſted the whole Fabrick and Model of Government into a perfect form; nor projected meet expedients, whereby it might become practicable amongſt us, I confeſſe I may fall ſhort of expectation in that particular, and in ſo weighty a caſe it would be neceſſary for the ableſt and ſtrongeſt parts to aſſiſt. Yet though the caſe be difficult, and our Nation and Government reduced to extremity of hazard and danger, I doubt not but ſomething might be done, (through the Lords aſſiſtance) in order to our eſtabliſhment in truth and Peace, would it pleaſe the Lord to open the hearts of the Rulers and people to accept and imbrace wholeſome and ſeaſonable Counſel. And then I ſhould look at it as my du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e abouts, if I were thereunto cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But if propoſal of the ſweetneſs and amiableneſs, the Peace and righteouſneſs of Chriſts Government, ſhall not find ſo much acceptance, as to incline the peoples hearts to make experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and proof of the ſame, by a profeſſed ſubjection to his Royal Soveraign power, it is becauſe the Lord hath more breaking work for us, ere we can be fit to bear his Yoke, whoſe yoke is eaſie and burden light; Eſpecially when we compaſſe it with the heavy yokes of men. And in ſuch caſe as this, it would be in vain to attempt any thing of that Nature. You may conſider what the Lord hath written of ſome Country (whether <hi>England</hi> or ſome other <hi>Iſlands,</hi> I determine not,) <hi>Iſai.</hi> 24. 13, 14. that there muſt be a vintage and preſſing of them, like as grapes are preſſed, ere they be fit to be new-moulded. Which I fear may be our caſe. Accept therefore in good part what I have here in love and faithfulneſs tendred; and let every one improve it to a right end. I know full well that God hath reſerved the chief honour of ſetting up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt in it's full luſtre and beauty, unto his own people the Jews, <hi>to them ſhall come the firſt Dominion,</hi> Mich. 4. 8. Yet ſomething we might do, (and I believe we ſhall, after this breaking work is over,) in order to the ſetting up of this Kingdom of Chriſt in <hi>England,</hi> according to the Divine light of the Word of truth, as it is written, <hi>Iſai. 24. 15. Wherefore with URIM</hi> (or Divine light) <hi>do ye glorify Jehovah in the Iſles of the Sea: the name of Jehovah the God of Iſrael.</hi> The word <hi>Urim,</hi> is written with a ſhort vowel, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to intimate that the heavenly light which thoſe Saints ſhall have, is far ſhort of that fulneſs of light, which will ſhine forth when Chriſt comes in perſon to ſet up his Kingdom; for he will come with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or fulneſs of heavenly light and perfection, as <hi>Zorobabel</hi> intimates in his ſpeech, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 2. 63. Which never yet was fulfilled, nor never will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is worth our conſideration, to take notice of the time when the Prophet took up this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. It was at a moſt troubleſome ſeaſon, in the latter end of <hi>Ahaz</hi> Reign, a moſt wicked and Apoſtate Prince, whom the Lord had ſet a brand of perpetual infamy upon, <hi>This is that King Ahaz.</hi> At which time alſo, <hi>Rezin</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Pekah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Remaliah,</hi> and the Nations round about, came againſt the people of God with open mouth to devour them. In this exigence, and at this time, the Prophet takes up this Meditation of Chriſt, and of his Kingdom, for his own and the Churches conſolation in thoſe gloomy dayes. And what is it of Chriſt, that he doth (now in this caſe) fix the eye of his Faith upon, for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his Spirit, now the Church is encompaſſed with enemies from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and afflicted with an Apoſtate Prince at home?

                  </gap> in this time of calamity. And in the Name of the Lord he doth aſſure the people of God, That in the Lords appointed time they ſhall have ſuch a Son born unto them, as ſhould in Gods way, and in Gods time, take upon him the Royal Power over the Throne and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>David</hi> his Father, and then he ſhall deliver them from all their enemies, and from all ſuch fears and tyrannies under which they now complained. <hi>To us</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall a Childe be born, unto us ſhall a Son be given, and the Government ſhall be upon his ſhoulder:</hi> And therefore let not your hearts be dejected, be not deſpondent. As who ſhould ſay, This ſhall not alwayes be your condition; and be you comforted with the thoughts of this <hi>MESSIAH,</hi> and of his righteous and peaceable Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The connexion therefore of theſe words with the former, may afford us this Inſtruction:
<q>That the Meditation of Chriſt, is a moſt ſpecial Cordial for Chriſtians, in<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> the moſt gloomy, darkſome, and calamitous times, that may befal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in particular, or the Churches of Chriſt in general.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This we ſee was the Prophets practiſe here, and ſo have the Saints done in all Ages. I might give you many inſtances, but let one ſerve for all. Behold <hi>David,</hi> a man of Meditations, and never more, then when he was hunted up and down as a Partridge upon the Mountains; and when he was thus perſecuted in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Judah,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Pſal. 63. 5, 6. My ſoul ſhall be ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſs, and my mouth ſhall praiſe thee with joyful lips: When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night-watches.</hi> And again he ſaith in <hi>Pſal. 104. 34. My medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of him ſhall be ſweet: I will be glad in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I may ſay of theſe Meditations, they are a Chriſtians <hi>Sweets:</hi> They are ſweet at all times, and yield to the ſoul moſt raviſhing conſolations, but moſt eſpecially in times of ſad calamity and diſtreſs.

And ſo it was with <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he had met with Chriſt in a time of deep diſtreſs, he would not let him go; He knew not how to part with him, if the Lord had not left <hi>Jacob,</hi> and given him a new Name, and a Bleſſing together with it. But I onely give a touch upon it by the way, becauſe it is not the ſubject I principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to inſiſt upon at this time. Yet let it provoke Chriſtians at all ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but ſpecially in ſad hours, when clouds of darkneſs and obſcurity encompaſs them round, then let them be take themſelves to this heavenly exerciſe of Meditation. And whatſoever the matter of your complaints be, ſee that you meditate upon ſomething in Chriſt, that may be a ſutable ſupport in ſuch a caſe: For it pleaſeth the Father, that <hi>in him all fulneſs ſhall dwell;</hi> and he hath Cordials of all ſorts. Are your Rulers turned back, and become Apoſtates? Have they broken Proteſtations, Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117430:4"/> and Oathes? Are your Deliverers become a Snare to you; and are you in danger to be ſwallowed up of enemies both at home and abroad? Then remember, Chriſt ſhall reign in Righteouſneſs and Peace; and be aſſured, deliverance will come, and the time is now at hand. And let this Meditation be a <hi>Cordial</hi> to your drooping ſpirits: He is ſuch a gracious and righteous Prince, that he will not caſt the ſervants of God into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and rent them from their relations, and ſhut them cloſe Priſoners, when he hath nothing in matter of <hi>Fact</hi> that may be charged upon them: No, Chriſt will not ſo do, he will not rule over you with rigour, as <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> did over the Iſraelites, fear ye not.

But I paſs it over, and come to the words of the Text, which in the firſt place I ſhall open by way of Paraphraſe.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> he means the Church of the Jews, according to what is ſpoken <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 6. and 49. 6. <hi>I will give thee for a Covenant to the people,</hi> (to wit, the Jews) <hi>and for a Light to the Nations.</hi> So that his meaning is, God will give to the Jews ſuch a Son, as ſhall ſit upon the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> to execute Judgement and Juſtice. It is the promiſe of a bleſſing then to come: And the phraſe <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us,</hi> or <hi>For us,</hi> or <hi>Of us</hi> a Son ſhall be born, implies, That the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> here promiſed (according to his Humane Nature) ſhall be born and deſcend of the Jewiſh race; And that in the firſt place, he was given for them, they then being the onely Church of Chriſt in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the GOVERNMENT ſhall be upon his ſhoulder.</hi>] The conjunction argues, That it was already on his ſhoulder, in regard of one of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſhall in Gods appointed time be laid upon his ſhoulder in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his Humane Nature alſo.

                  <hi>The Everlaſting Father,</hi>] Chriſt is ſo called in a double reſpect: 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he begetteth us through the Goſpel adminiſtred by his Servants, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 15. And hence it is, that Converſion is called <hi>a new birth.</hi> 2. Chriſt is the Everlaſting Father, in regard of Creation; <hi>He is the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh,</hi> Numb. 16. 22. Moreover, Chriſt is called, <hi>The Prince of Peace;</hi> or, as the Apoſtle calls him, He is firſt King of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, (typified by <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> Gen. 14 18.) and then King of Peace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 1, 2,</p>
               <p>The <hi>extent</hi> of this <hi>Government,</hi> is expreſſed by an unuſual form of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the word <hi>Increaſe;</hi> which here, and nowhere elſe, that I remember, is written with <hi>Mem finale,</hi> in a quadrangular form, to ſhew that this <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>

               <p>The Subject or Object of this <hi>Government,</hi> about which it ſhould be converſant, it is not ſaid, Upon <hi>Zion,</hi> but <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the Throne and Kingdom of David;</hi> to ſhew, that he means not a <hi>Government</hi> over the Church in an Eccleſiaſtical way, but a Government over the Common-wealth in a Civil way.</p>
               <p>The effects of this <hi>Government</hi> are theſe two, to order and to ſupport it, amplified by the means of this Support, <hi>Judgement and Juſtice: For by Juſtice the Throne is eſtabliſhed,</hi> Prov. 16. 12. Thus have you the words briefly opened. I ſhall onely raiſe one Obſervation from the ſame, as that which I conceive to be chiefly intended, and ſhall lay down as a firm <hi>Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which all the Powers in the world ſhall not be able to overthrow:
<q>That the Power of Civil-Government is laid upon the ſhoulder of Jeſus<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> Chriſt, the MESSIAH, the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and to him it doth of right belong.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This I take to be the chief ſcope of the words, and the great Promiſe here held forth, That there ſhould come a time, when the <hi>MESSIAH</hi> ſhould exerciſe Rule and Dominion, as a Prince, over all Nations of the world, as well in <hi>Temporal</hi> or <hi>Civil</hi> things, as in <hi>Spirituals.</hi> Now that I may the better clear this Truth, conſider, That there are three kindes of <hi>Government,</hi> and they are all laid upon the ſhoulder of the <hi>MES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIAH.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. There is an Univerſal <hi>Government,</hi> over all the Creation and Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip<note place="margin">1. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Government.</note> of God. The parts of which <hi>Government</hi> (that I may ſo ſpeak)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117430:5"/> are two: 1. The <hi>Law-giving</hi> part, which Chriſt exerciſed in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, giving unto every creature a Law, and imprinting the ſame upon them, or putting the ſame within them. And this we commonly call the <hi>Law of Nature;</hi> whereof we can give no reaſon, but the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Creator. Hence ſprings thoſe ſecret Virtues in the <hi>Magnet,</hi> and many precious Stones, Herbs, and Minerals; the ebbings and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Sea, which Philoſophers ignorantly and abſurdly attribute to the Moon, putting the Effect before the Cauſe. Hence it is, that Fire burneth, and Water quencheth, and all things act according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Natures, which is none other, but the Law given them by the Lord Jeſus in the Creation. For we muſt underſtand, <hi>that the worlds were made by him,</hi> Heb. 1. 2. <hi>and without him was not any thing made that was made,</hi> Joh. 1. 3. And the ſame day that he created them, he gave them a <hi>Law:</hi> To the Heavens he gave their Motions, the firſt day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 1. And on the fourth day he gave the Sun, and Moon, and Stars their Motions: So that as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal. 19. 1, 4, 5. The Sun like a bridegroom cometh forth of his chamber; and rejoyceth as a ſtrong man to run his race.</hi> And on the fifth day he gave a <hi>Law</hi> to the Herbs, Trees, Plants, Fowls, Fiſhes, Beaſts, and every creeping thing, to produce their like, for propagation of their kinde. And as <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaith, Chap. 8. ver. 7. <hi>The Stork in the heavens know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her appointed times; and the Turtle, and the Crane, and the Swallow ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the time of their coming.</hi> It was the <hi>MESSIAH</hi> that appointed a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitude of <hi>Seed-time and Harveſt, Cold and Heat, Summer and Winter, Day and Night,</hi> Gen. 8. 22. He alſo <hi>ſet barres and doors to the Sea, ſaying, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto thou ſhalt come, and here ſhall the pride of thy Waves be ſtayed,</hi> Job 38. 11. Thus you ſee Chriſt gives a Law to all the Creatures, according to which they ſhall <hi>act,</hi> and cannot do otherwiſe, without a countermand from him. And this he doth, by his abſolute Soveraignty over the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, expreſſed by the Potters power over the Clay, as <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaith, Chap. 18. ver. 6. <hi>We are the clay, and thou our Potter; we are all the work of thine hands.</hi> But let none miſtake me, as if I did exclude the other Perſons, when I aſcribe this Power to the Son, as <hi>Paul</hi> alſo doth in the place afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alledged.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of this <hi>Government,</hi> you may call <hi>Providential;</hi> I mean, that Power, whereby he guideth and ruleth all things which himſelf hath made; acting the Creatures, ſometimes beſides, and ſometime con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the firſt Law given them. Now this part of Univerſal-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he doth exerciſe, ſometimes by himſelf alone, and ſometimes by the Miniſtery of his holy Angels.</p>
               <p>I ſhall give ſome inſtances, for better explaining of my minde: 1. Chriſt exerciſeth this Power himſelf immediately, in two ſorts of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. As firſt, in things that ſeem caſual and accidental; as when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a Ram for a Sacrifice, in ſtead of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 22. 13. And therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> calls that place, <hi>Jehovah-jireh.</hi> So when a man heweth wood, and the Ax falls from the helve, and kills a man, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 5. this is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 13. Secondly, in ſuch things as are above the power of all created Natures, or contrary to the firſt Law of Nature given to the Creature: Such are all the great Miracles which Chriſt Jeſus
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117430:6"/> wrought; <hi>The blinde receive their ſight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleanſed, the deaf hear, the dead are raiſed up, and the poor receive the Goſpel preached unto them.</hi> And the reſtraint which he puts upon the Creatures, whereof you may reade <hi>Job 38. 26, 31. He bindes up the ſweet influences of Ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ades,</hi> &amp;c. And in the dayes of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> he cauſed the Sun and Moon to ſtand ſtill, and all the Celeſtial Motions together with them: and in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> be made them all go backward: He darkned and eclipſed the Sun at noon-day, when the Moon was at full, <hi>Luke 23. 44. He alſo divided the Sea, and cauſed his people to paſs through; and made the waters to ſtand as an heap: In the day-time he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire: He clave the Rock in the wilderneſs, and cauſed waters to run down like rivers,</hi> Pſal. 78. 13, 14, 15, 16. And which yet may adde unto the Wonder, he made the Rock to follow them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. It was he, that wrought thoſe Wonders in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> Pſal. 78. 12. and divided the Waters of <hi>Jordan,</hi> Pſal. 114. 4, 7. and many inſtances more might be produced of like nature. He ſtirreth up the Princes of the earth one againſt another; as it is ſaid, <hi>Iſa. 64 8. I have raiſed up one from the North, and he ſhall come, from the riſing of the Sun ſhall he call upon my Name: And he ſhall come upon Princes as upon morter, even as the Potter treadeth clay:</hi> He ſpirits them for ſuch ſervices. All theſe, and many more, are the acts of Providence, which he puts forth immediately by himſelf. But ſecondly, Chriſt often puts forth his acts of Providence, by the Miniſtery of his holy Angels, as Officers and Miniſters to him, eſpecially for the good of his choſen people. In regard whereof, this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world is ſubjected unto Angels, as the Apoſtles words imply, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 5. Thus he uſed the Miniſtery of Angels, to deliver the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> whileſt he revealed himſelf face to face unto <hi>Moſes</hi> for the ſpace of fourty dayes together, <hi>Heb. 2. 2. Gal.</hi> 3. 19. So alſo, he appointeth ſome of them, to negotiate the Churches affairs in Princes Courts, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 21, 23. Others to fight againſt the enemies of his people, as it is ſaid <hi>Dan. 10. 20. Now I will return to fight with the King of Perſia:</hi> And 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 35. one Angel ſlew in the Camp of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> in one night, one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred eighty five thouſand. Let <hi>Sword-men</hi> conſider what they do, for whom they fight, and againſt whom they fight; for Angels go forth to Warre, and Swords and Bullets cannot pierce them: They are miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth for the good of them that are heirs of Salvation. Therefore, offend not one of theſe little ones that believe in me; <hi>for I ſay unto you, That in heaven their Angels do alwayes behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.</hi> The Angels have a ſpecial charge to keep them; and as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal. 34. 7. The Angel of the Lord encampeth about them that fear him.</hi> Remember here the mad attempt of the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> againſt <hi>Eliſha,</hi> the Lords Prophet, and the guard of Angels that was about him, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 16, 17, 18. They keep watch about them, and in time of aſſault, they turn aſide many a Bullet, and many a thruſt from the Saints. And as they are for protection and defence to them; ſo they will be an offence to ſuch as do them wrong. They direct the weapons of Chriſts Servants to do execution, and adde ſtrength unto their hands. And if this be not enough to deterre Fourth-Monarchy-men from medling with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117430:6"/> the Servants of Chriſt; then let them know, That they have not onely an Hoſt of Angels to encounter with, but Chriſt himſelf, who rideth forth upon his White Horſe, with a Veſture dipped in blood, <hi>Rev. 19. 11, 13. Iſa.</hi> 63. 2. And he is a man of Warre, and regards neither Troopers nor Footmen, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 3. At his appearance, the ſtouteſt Captains ſhall cry out to the Mountains, and to Rocks, to fall upon them, and hide them from the wrath of the Lamb, <hi>Rev. 6. 16. Iſa.</hi> 2. 19. Remember, that in the dayes of his Fleſh, the Souldiers and Officers that came to meddle with him, gave back, and fell to the ground, at one milde word of his, <hi>I am he.</hi> What then will you do, when he cometh with his Power and great Glory? Let this be conſidered, of thoſe that ſmite their fellow-ſervants, and evil intreat his Meſſengers, that wait for the coming of this glorious Day of the Lord; and know, That you have been fore-warned. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, Chriſt improveth the Miniſtery of holy Angels, for proviſion, as when <hi>Elijah</hi> wanted meat, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 6, 7. And for Inſtruction, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 16. and 9. 21. And for Direction of our courſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 17, And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for Correction of his own Servanrs, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 15. Yea, Chriſt maketh uſe of evil Angels for puniſhment of wicked men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 49. and ſometimes (but very rarely) for the tryal of his own Servants, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 12. Thus you ſee the vaſt extent of Chriſts Government over all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; which is ſuch, as all men will confeſs it is too heavy for any, but the ſhoulder of Chriſt to bear. But this is not the Government which is principally intended in the Text: for this is not reſtrained to the Throne and Kingdom of <hi>David,</hi> as in the Text; nor could it be foretold as a matter then to come, for Chriſt hath exerciſed this his Soveraign Power and Government over the whole Creature, even from the beginning of the world. And all men will confeſs, That this Power of Government, is too weighty for any but the ſhoulder of Chriſt to bear.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is another <hi>Government,</hi> which Chriſt exerciſeth over his Church, as King of Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 3. And this we call <hi>Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> Which <hi>Government</hi> appertains alſo unto the <hi>MESSIAH.</hi> In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect whereof, he is ſometime called <hi>King of Zion,</hi> Joh. 12. 15. ſometime <hi>King Jeſus,</hi> Act. 17. 7. ſometime the <hi>Head of his Church,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 3. Eph. 5. 23. ſometime, <hi>The Bridegroom,</hi> Joh. 3. 29. Mat. 9. 15. All which expreſſions do hold forth the Soveraign Power and <hi>Government</hi> of Chriſt over his Church. And this Government hath alſo two parts: 1. The <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi> Power. 2. The <hi>Ministerial</hi> Power. Firſt then, Chriſt Jeſus the <hi>MESSIAH</hi> hath the Power to give Laws unto his Church, and to appoint Officers and Cenſures. And this Power belongs onely to him, as is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally acknowledged of all that are not groſly Popiſh and Antichriſtian. Which Power is ſo weighty, that no ſhoulder is able to bear it, but the ſhoulder of Chriſt. He both gives them Laws, and appoints Officers, and qualifieth them with gifts fit for their ſeveral Functions; and for that end he aſcended up on high, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 8. Secondly, there is a Miniſterial Power, which Chriſt hath committed, firſt, to his Church, to chooſe their own Officers, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 3. Which Officers are of four ſorts, Paſtors, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, Elders, Deacons, reſembled by the four living Creatures, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 6, 7. Secondly, Chriſt hath more eſpecially committed the Power of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117430:7"/> unto theſe Officers. And in reſpect of this Power and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over the Church, Chriſt is called <hi>That</hi> Prophet, by way of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, <hi>Joh. 6. 14. &amp; 1. 21, 25. Acts</hi> 3. 23. Of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> propheſied, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 18. But yet this is not the Government principally intended by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But 3. there is another kinde of <hi>Government,</hi> ſuch as Rulers and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces exerciſe over their Subjects, which we commonly call <hi>Civil-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> This <hi>Government</hi> is converſant about the Bodies and Eſtates of men, and the well ordering of the Commonwealth in Juſtice and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And this is that Government, of which the Prophet doth here principally ſpeak, as may appeat both from the Text it ſelf, and from other Scriptures alſo, that ſpeak of this Kingdome of the <hi>MES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIAH.</hi>

               <p>Now from the Text you may take notice of four things principally, that argue this <hi>Government</hi> to be ſpoken of <hi>Civil-Government.</hi> As 1. The Name or Style given to the <hi>Government.</hi> 2. The Names given unto the Meſſiah or chief Governour. 3. The Subject or Object of his <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> 4. The Acts of Government which he putteth forth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Style given to this Government, it is called <hi>Hammiſrah,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Government,</hi> or Principality. This <note n="e" place="margin">

                  <hi>The Prince of Peace:</hi> and the word <hi>Prince</hi> is derived of ſuch a word,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117430:7"/> as ſignifies Kingly Rule and Dominion, as was ſhewed before.

               <p>Thus you ſee it cleared from the Text, That the <hi>Government</hi> there ſpoken of, muſt neceſſarily be underſtood of <hi>Civil Government.</hi> Let me now produce ſome Arguments of the like nature, drawn from other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, that ſpeak of the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> And they will demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratively prove, That <hi>Civil Government</hi> and <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> do of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Son of <hi>David,</hi> our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that bleſſed and onely Potentate, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 15. Theſe Arguments I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to ſix Heads:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Style given to the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> argueth that it is not <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> but <hi>Civil.</hi> It is called an <hi>Abſolute</hi>

Hence the Turks derive the Name of their chiefeſt Lords, whom they call <hi>Sultans.</hi> This is ſuch a power of Government, as cannot be applied to <hi>Church-Government,</hi> but is always attributed to earthly Princes Power, in reference to mens perſons and eſtates, and ordering of the Commonwealths Affairs; which is a Power that was never allowed to Churches or Church-Officers. And <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of that Power which the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould put forth, ſaith, <hi>Pſal. 72. 8. He ſhall have dominion from ſea to ſea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.</hi> The word there uſed for <note n="l" place="margin">

                  <hi>Dominion,</hi> doth ſignifie ſuch a power as is inconſiſtent with <hi>Church Government:</hi> It is ſuch a <hi>Dominion</hi> and Rule, as Maſters do exerciſe over their ſervants, <hi>Levit. 25. 43. Thou ſhalt not rule over him with rigour:</hi> or, as <hi>Adam</hi> did exerciſe <hi>over the fiſhes of the ſea, and fowls of the air, and every thing that moveth upon the earth,</hi> Gen. 1. 28. where the ſame word is uſed. And who can with any pretence or colour of reaſon ſuppoſe, That that ſhould be an Eccleſiaſtical Power? Yea, it is ſuch a ruling power, as Princes exerciſe over their enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:117430:8"/> 110. 2. <hi>Rule thou in the midſt of thine enemies.</hi> Wherefore we muſt needs conclude, That Civil Government doth of Right belong to Jeſus Chriſt, unleſs we ſhall willingly ſhut our eyes againſt the clear light of Truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Titles given to Chriſt do argue, That Civil Power belongs to him. He is called, The <hi>GREAT KING,</hi> in reference to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or the Commonwealth, <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Sometimes I alledged alſo 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 15. and applied thoſe words, <hi>The bleſſed and onely Potentate,</hi> unto Chriſt; as if the Apoſtle had ſpoken immediately of Chriſt. Leſt any therefore ſhould miſtake the place, as I alſo did, till I looked into the Original, I thought it good to advertiſe every one, to examine duly the words in their proper tongue, ere they relye upon any interpretation given. But yet the miſtake is not great, becauſe that which is ſpoken of the Divine Nature, may alſo by communication of properties be attributed to the Humane Nature uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Second Perſon. He is the King of kings, and Lord of lords, as hath been ſhewed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We may fetch another Argument, from the Royal Seat of the <hi>Meſſiahs Government,</hi> or the place of his Throne and Court; which is not here ſaid to be <hi>Zion,</hi> or the Church; but <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> and <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> in Scripture-phraſe, is frequently put for the <hi>Civil State.</hi> And for that cauſe, it is called, The City of the great King, <hi>Mat. 5. 35. Swear not by Jeruſalem, for it is the City of the great King.</hi> Why? were not <hi>Hebron,</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> and other Cities of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> his Cities? Yea verily, but they are not the Royal Seat of this <hi>great King,</hi> or the place of his Court and Throne, the place of his reſidence. That will be at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> For, <hi>There do the thrones of Judgement remain, (or ſit) the thrones of the houſe of David,</hi> Pſal. 122. 5.

And it ſhall come to paſs, that every one that is left of all the Nations which came againſt Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, ſhall even go up from year to year to worſhip the King, the Lord of Hoſts, and to keep the feaſt of Tabernacles: And it ſhall be, that whoſoever will not come up of the families of the earth to Jeruſalem, to worſhip the King, the Lord of Hoſts, even upon them ſhall be no rain.</hi> This King, undoubtedly is King Jeſus, the promiſed <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> of whom the Angel ſpeaketh to <hi>Mary,</hi> Luke 1. 32. <hi>He ſhall be great, or ſhall be called the ſon of the MOST HIGH: and the Lord God ſhall give unto him the Throne of his Father David: And

And it is one thing to <hi>appear,</hi> and to order and conſtitute Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; another thing to <hi>reſide</hi> and exerciſe the ſame. But I ſhall conclude nothing poſitively as to that particular.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Acts of <hi>Judgement</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> which are put forth in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> are ſuch as appertain to <hi>Civil,</hi> not unto <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Juriſdiction. Let me inſtance in ſome <hi>Acts,</hi> and I ſhall begin with that which <hi>David</hi> mentions, <hi>Pſal. 72. 14. He ſhall judge thy people with juſtice, and thy poor with judgement: He ſhall redeem their ſoul from ſorce and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:</hi> which Churches cannot do by Church-power. And <hi>Pſal. 76. 12. He cutteth off the ſpirit of Princes.</hi> And <hi>Pſal. 110. 5, 6. He ſtrikes through Kings in the day of his wrath: He ſhall judge among the Nations, he ſhall fill [them] with dead bodies; he ſhall wound the Heads over many countreys.</hi> And <hi>Rev. 19. 15. Out of his mouth goeth a ſharp ſword, that with it he ſhould ſmite the Nations: and he ſhall rule them with a Rod of iron.</hi> And <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaking of this Kingdom of the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> and the little Stone cut out of the Mountain without hands, ſaith, <hi>Dan. 2. 35, 45. Then were broken in pieces (as one) the iron, the clay, the braſs, the ſilver, and the gold, and they became as the chaff of the ſummer threſhing-floors, and the wind carried them away, that no place of them was ſound: and the ſtone that ſmote the Image, became a great Mountain, and filled all the earth.</hi> And ver. 45. he ſaith, that the Stone cut out of the Mountain without hands, <hi>it brake in pieces the iron, the braſs, the clay, the ſilver, and the gold.</hi> Now how diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable is it unto Church-power, To reſcue men from force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; to behead Princes; to ſtrike through Kings in wrath; to judge Nations with ſuch a Judgement as filleth them with dead bodies; to wound Captains and Rulers over many Nations; to ſmite the Nations, and rule them with an iron Rod; yea, to break them, and make them as the duſt of the Summer threſhing-floors? Theſe are ſuch <hi>acts</hi> as do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Churches to exerciſe as Churches. Should it be put unto Princes and Rulers to judge, whether it be fit to allow Churches ſuch a power; I trow they would anſwer in the Negative. They will tell you, That the <hi>Acts</hi> aforementioned appertain to the Juriſdiction of Civil Princes and Potentates. And if ſo, how can it be denied, that this <hi>Civil Power</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> who is <hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords;</hi> or whom,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117430:9"/> 
                  <hi>David, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> did propheſie, in the places afore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Acknowledgements which the People, Nations, and Languages, yea, and Kings themſelves, do tender unto this great King (the <hi>Meſsiah</hi>) and to his Government, are ſuch, as do plainly argue, That Civil Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction belongeth to Chriſt Jeſus, the <hi>Meſsiah.</hi> Let me inſtance in two particulars: 1. Homage and Fealty is due to Chriſt, as you may reade <hi>Dan. 7. 14. All People, Nations, and Languages ſhall ſerve him,</hi> or do Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to him. And <hi>Pſal. 72. 11. All Kings ſhall bow down to him; all the Nations ſhall do him homage.</hi> And ver. 9. <hi>They that dwell in the wilderneſs ſhall bow before him; and his enemies ſhall lick the duſt.</hi> 2. Tribute: Not that this King Jeſus will put upon them Taxes, Impoſitions, Cuſtoms, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cize,<note place="margin">No Cuſtoms or Excize in the days of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah.</note> or the like (that is contrary to his nature, and the ſweetneſs of his Government) but the Nations come freely, and offer gifts: His people are a willing people in the day of his power. And thus it is ſaid, <hi>Pſa. 72. 10, 15. The Kings of Tarſhiſh, and the Iſles, ſhall bring an offering; the Kings</hi>

If they ſhould come and bow to them; but moſt of all, if they would come and bring them all manner of coſtly Merchandize, and the <hi>gold</hi> of <hi>Ophir</hi> too! Oh how would their hearts skip for joy! But 'tis much to be feared, if this ſhould be the condition of the carnal proud Clergy-men (as they are called) they would do, as ſometimes good <hi>Aaron</hi> did, make <hi>Calves</hi> to pleaſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Indeed, ſuch free offerings and gifts may well beſeem the Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſts Kingdom, (when the Jews ſhall be called) to ſupport the vaſt expence, which the Rulers muſt neceſſarily and inevitably under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, in reparation of their Cities and houſes, and entertainment of their own Countreymen, which will be daily flocking, as Doves to the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows. And alſo, for the honourable entertainment and accommodation of the Meſſengers and Ambaſſadors, which will be ſent unto them from all the Nations in every Quarter of the World. And alſo, as a thankful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement unto the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> who by this time will have turned their Swords into Plow-ſhares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks, ſo as they ſhall never learn warre any more. No marvel then, if the mercenary Souldiers of this Age, cannot indure to hear of this Kingdom, or Fifth Monarchy; for then away goes Swords and Spears, and Courts of Guard, which is now their livelyhood and maintenance. But there will be no need of ſuch things then.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Jeſus Chriſt hath formerly exerciſed Civil Power. He hath given Laws, Statutes, and Judgements, and granted Commiſſion unto meet Officers to execute the ſame; and therefore the power of Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth belong to him of right. Now that Chriſt hath exerciſed ſuch a power, is manifeſt: Witneſs all the Laws, Statutes, and Judgements, given to Gods people by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he brought them out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> And that Government he exerciſed for the ſpace of many hundreds of years together, until the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, when
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117430:9"/> 
                  <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> the Head of <hi>Image-government,</hi> wreſted it (as I may ſay) out of Chriſts hand. But Chriſt hath promiſed, That as formerly he did exerciſe this power, ſo he will aſſume this power again, when he hath broken down all <hi>Image-government;</hi> and then he will <hi>reſtore Judges unto his people as at the firſt, and Counſellors as at the beginning,</hi> Iſa. 1. 26. And then ſhall his people have no Laws nor Judgments but his; as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Iſa. 33. 22. Jehovah is our Judge, Jehovah is our Law-giver, Jehovah is our King, he will ſave us.</hi> From all which Arguments laid together, we may undoubtedly conclude, That the power of Civil Government doth of right belong unto Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>Meſsiah;</hi> and that he will again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume this power, and the exerciſe thereof, when he hath broken thoſe powers that have <hi>Outed</hi> him from his Inheritance; and then will he reign moſt gloriouſly. This was the Opinion of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and all the Prophets, as hath been ſhewed: And this was the Opinion of the eleven Apoſtles, as may appear by the Queſtion they put to our Lord Jeſus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Reſurrection, <hi>Acts 1. 6. Lord, wilt thou at this time reſtore the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to Iſrael?</hi> A Kingdome then they did expect. And mark Chriſts anſwer; He doth not deny, that ſuch a <hi>Kingdome</hi> ſhould be, (which in faithfulneſs he would have done, to undeceive them, had their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments been erroneous) but he tells them, their <hi>Queſtion</hi> was unſeaſonable: <hi>It is not for you to know the times and ſeaſons, which the Father hath put in his own power.</hi> Belike then, the Lord Jeſus was of the ſame judgement too, as well as his Apoſtles and Prophets of old: onely it was not then a<note place="margin">The Fifth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy is an ancient Opinion</note> fit ſeaſon for them to inquire about it, nor ſor him to anſwer. He had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other manner of Kingdom to inſtruct them in, thoſe fourty dayes which he was converſant with them; being now about to aboliſh the old Paeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogie of the Jewiſh Adminiſtrations, and to inſtitute more Spiritual and Goſpel-like Ordinances in the room. And it was as neceſſary to take up thoſe fourty dayes to principle them in all things that concerned that Kingdom, as formerly to inſtruct <hi>Moſes:</hi> and therefore he <hi>ſuperſedes</hi> that inquiry for that time. But if you mark it, you ſhall finde, that after the pouring forth of the Spirit at the day of Pentecoſt, <hi>Peter</hi> preacheth this Kingdom, and calls it the time of the reſtitution of all things, ſpoken of by the mouth of all the holy Prophets ſince the world began, <hi>Act.</hi> 3 21. And the word <note n="m" place="margin">

                  <hi>Reſtitution,</hi> doth ſignifie a ſetting of a thing in its right and ancient eſtate, as thoſe who underſtand the Language do well know: And it is the ſame word which the Apoſtles uſed, when they asked that Queſtion aforementioned. This therefore is no new or ſingular Opinion, but ſuch as the godly people of thoſe times were generally taken with; us doth alſo appear by the requeſt which the Mother of <hi>Zebedees</hi> children made to Chriſt, in behalf of her two Sons, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> that they might ſit, the one on his right hand, and the other on his left hand in his Kingdom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 20. To whom Chriſt anſwers, and tells her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That that ſpecial favour was to be conferred on ſuch, for whom the Father had prepared it: Which doth infer, That ſuch a Kingdom as they expected, ſhould in due ſeaſon be; wherein the Lord Jeſus ſhould be honoured as a King in his Kingdom, and it ſhould be the ſpecial honour of ſome or other to ſit next him upon his Throne, both at his right hand and at his left.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:117430:10"/> But he blames them for their ignorance and ambition, and tells them, there muſt be a time of miniſtery and of ſuffering firſt; and ſets his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample before them for a patern: Secretly implying, That as the Father puts excelling honour upon the Son above all others, in regard of his low and voluntary abaſement of himſelf, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9. So thoſe that pledge him deepeſt in that Cup, ſhall be honoured with that favour which they requeſted, to ſit next unto him in his Kingdom: which may encourage Chriſtians to be willing to ſuffer for Chriſt cheerfully; they ſhall be no loſers by it. I may cloſe up this Point with one <hi>New-Teſtament</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>All power is given to me,</hi> Mat. 28 18. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That the Civil Magiſtrate is ſome part of power, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. Whence the Concluſion naturally ariſeth, That Civil Power belongs to Chriſt, by gift from the Father. And <hi>Paul</hi> tells <hi>Timothy,</hi> that God, who is the bleſſed and onely Potentate, the King of kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will make an open <hi>ſhew</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord at his appearing. And what <hi>ſhew</hi> is it, that the Father will make of Chriſt at that day? Doubtleſs, he will make a <hi>ſhew</hi> of him in all his Glory; but eſpecially in this part of his Glory, as Soveraign Lord and King over all the Princes of the World, as thoſe words without doubt do import. For elſe, if the Apoſtle had meant onely or principally to advertiſe <hi>Timothy,</hi> that the Father would have made a <hi>ſhew</hi> of Chriſt as Head of his Church, he might have ſtyled him, <hi>The Father, King of Saints,</hi> or <hi>King of Sion,</hi> as well as <hi>King of kings. John</hi> therefore calls him, <hi>King of kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of lords,</hi> Revelat. 19. 16.</p>
               <p>So that if Chriſtian Gentiles, in this peeviſh and perverſe generation, towards the end of Antichriſts reign, were not wilfully blinde, and in this reſpect worſe then Jews, they would not deny this part of Chriſts Royal Power. For, as the Prophets and Apoſtles, and Primitive Chriſtians, yea Chriſt himſelf were of this judgement, That there ſhould be a time when Chriſt ſhould reign as a King in this World, and thoſe alſo that have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered with him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 10. So the Jews at this day believe it, and wait for it: Onely God hath not yet opened their eyes to ſee, and their hearts to believe, That that Jeſus which was born of <hi>Mary,</hi> of the Seed of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Herod,</hi> is that promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whereof the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets do ſpeak. Yet ſome of them do confeſs, That ſince the dayes of their Fathers, there hath not been any ſo like the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> as this Jeſus, which we Chriſtians do profeſs. Of whom <hi>Joſephus</hi> gives a very honourable teſtimony, doubting whether he might call him a meer Man, in regard of the Divine Majeſty that appeared in him. Oh! that their eyes were once opened to ſee him, whom they have pierced, as <hi>Zachary</hi> propheſieth; they would then acknowledge, That <hi>Civil Power,</hi> yea <hi>All Power,</hi> doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him. And truly, ſuch Chriſtians as deny it, do declare themſelves to be Antichriſtian. But let them beware of ſiding with Antichriſt, and uſing Chriſt, as <hi>Hanun</hi> did the Meſſengers of <hi>David,</hi> cutting off half of his hair, and half of his garments; I mean, half of his Royalty, leſt it coſt them as dear, as it did the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and their Abettors. I have been the larger in proof of this <hi>Truth,</hi> which is the perſecuted <hi>Truth</hi> of this Generation; foraſmuch as ſome carnal Chriſtians, who minde their own
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:117430:10"/> pomp and glory, more then the Kingdom of Chriſt, do deny that any ſuch thing ſhall be, or ſay that it is yet afar off, and make a ſcoff at ſuch as they call <hi>Fifth Monarchy m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n,</hi> who long for nothing more, then the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of this Kingdom. And if the world were not beſotted with a love unto old Cuſtoms and vain Pomp, they would ſee reaſon to be willing of this Kingdom, wherein there will be no <hi>Taxes, Cuſtoms, Excize,</hi> nor any ſuch thing: Swords then will be turned into Plow-ſhares, and each man may live in peace and quier, enjoying his own Right. They ſhall not then be hurried to Priſons, and ſhut up ſtrait Priſoners, and rent from their relations, when there doth appear no matter of <hi>Fact</hi> to be charged upon them. Such ſervitude will not be heard of in that Kingdom. Wherefore, me-thinks, worldly men, upon a civil account, ſhould be willing of ſuch a Government, as this Kingdom of Chriſt will be.</p>
               <p>Having now proved, That all Power belongeth originally unto God<note place="margin">How Chriſt came by his Kingly Power.</note> the Father, and to Jeſus Chriſt his Son; and that the Power of <hi>Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> and Juriſdiction, in ſpecial belongeth unto Jeſus Chriſt, it will be neceſſary to inquire, how he came by this Power. For clearing of which, we are to conſider, that Royal Power may be obtained three ways: Either by Lineal Deſcent from the Father to the Son; or by Gift, or by Conqueſt. The Queſtion then will be, By which of theſe ways the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> obtained his Kingdom? I anſwer, Not by Deſcent, becauſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever liveth: Nor by Conqueſt, for that were the higheſt point of Diſloyalty and Treaſon that could be imagined, for the Son to riſe up againſt his Father, and to wreſt his Power out of his hands.</p>
               <q>Filius ante diem Patrios inquirit in annos.</q>
               <p>But Jeſus Chriſt obtained his Power and Soveraignty by <hi>Gift</hi> from his Father: <hi>Pſal. 2. 8. Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt ends of the earth for thy poſſeſsion.</hi> And <hi>Dan. 7. 14.

                     </gap>e Soveraignty, and Glory, and a Kingdom, that all People, Nations, and Languages ſhould ſerve him.</hi> Thus you ſee in what way he obtained this Power and Dominion, to wit, by free Gift from the Father: Even as <hi>Solomon</hi> (a Type of the <hi>Meſsiah</hi>) obtained the Kingdom by the gift of <hi>David</hi> his father, whileſt he yet lived, who cauſed the Crown to be ſet upon his Sons head, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 32, 34. He doth not uſurp it, as <hi>Adonijah</hi> would have done.</p>
               <p>Now this having been proved, That the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> hath all Power in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, and by conſequence all Civil Power, and that in a moſt juſt and righteous way, to wit, by free donation from the Father: It will be requiſite, to ſhew what part of this Soveraign Power he reſerveth unto himſelf, and what part he hath made over to his Vice-gerents, the Princes and Rulers of the Earth; that ſo Chriſt may have his due, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that which appertains to him. Take therefore theſe two Poſitions for a certain Truth.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>That all Power is given to Chriſt,</hi> Mat. 28. 18. <hi>and by conſequence, all Civil Power of making Laws and Judgements, and executing the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117430:11"/> ſame: Jehovah is our Judge, Jehovah is our Law giver, Jehovah is our King, he will ſave us,</hi> Iſa. 33. 22.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>No Man nor Angel may arrogate or wreſt out of Chriſts hand, that Power which the Father hath given him, nor any part thereof, except they have a deputation or delegation from him; but it will be Sacriledge and High Treaſon againſt the Kingly Power and Government of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antichriſt</hi> indeed hath challenged ſuch a Power in Spirituals; but his arrogancy begins daily more and more to be exploded. And the <hi>ten</hi> Kings or Kingdoms of the <hi>Fourth-Monarchy,</hi> have exerciſed ſuch a Juridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Judicial Power, but <hi>quo jure, by what right,</hi> it will be ſpoken of by and by. Let us firſt therefore conſider, what part of <hi>Power</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> this great King, hath reſerved to himſelf, as his peculiar <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For clearing of which point, let it be conſidered, That there are two parts of Civil Power, to wit, a Lordly Commanding Power, and a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Power: or the Power of giving Laws, and the Power of executing the ſame. The former, namely, The power of <hi>giving Laws,</hi> or the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Power, which is a Lordly Soveraign Power, Chriſt hath reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to himſelf, as his peculiar Royalty. This glory he will not give to another; No created <hi>Being</hi> in heaven or in earth being capable of ſuch a Power, ſaving he that is <hi>God-Man.</hi> It is too weighty for any ſhoulder, but the ſhoulder of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to bear; as I might inſtance in the three kindes of Government, Univerſal, Eccleſiaſtic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l, and Civil. And it is generally granted of all, that none but he can give a <hi>Law</hi> to the whole <hi>Creature.</hi> None but he can give <hi>Laws</hi> to his Church. Onely the diſpute is, whether he onely hath this Soveraign Power to give Laws and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Civil Matters. For anſwer whereunto, take that of <hi>Iſaiab</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-alledged, <hi>Jehovah is our Law-giver.</hi> And that this Power belongs to him onely, will better appear, if we conſider theſe two things: 1. What <hi>Law</hi> is. 2. What are the intrinſecal properties of <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the 1. What <hi>Law</hi> is? I anſwer, That <hi>Law</hi> is a <hi>preſcribed Rule,</hi> for<note place="margin">What Law is.</note> the well ordering of mens Converſation, whether in Church or in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: And Laws may be diſtinguiſhed into two ſorts, <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Judicial.</hi> As for the diſtinction of <hi>Laws</hi> into Moral and Civil Laws, it is of little uſe: For what are Civil Laws, but ſuch as concern the Manners of men, and their converſation one towards, or with another? So that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Laws (rightly ſo called) are no other, but <hi>Moral</hi> Laws: onely <hi>Moral</hi> Laws are of a larger extent, and do comprehend the duties we owe to God, as well as man. But this I ſay, That there is no <hi>Civil</hi> Law, but is comprehended within the Decalogue, which we call <hi>Moral</hi> Laws. Now all men will confeſs, That it is Chriſts <hi>Prerogative</hi> onely, to give <hi>Moral</hi> Laws, as you may reade in the 20 of <hi>Exodus,</hi> &amp;c. And that he onely hath this power, will appear upon theſe Grounds or Reaſons: 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is our Creator, and hath made us, <hi>Iſa. 43. 7. Every one that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by my Name, I have created him for my glory, I have formed him, yea I have made him.</hi> And who can give a Law to the Creature, but the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor? 2. He is our Redeemer; and for this reaſon he giveth Laws to his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:117430:11"/> people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 2. becauſe he brought them out of the land of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> 3. The truth of this may appear, from the <hi>intrinſccal</hi> properties, that ought to be in all <hi>Moral</hi> Laws and Judgements, (ſuch as the Laws of Chriſts Kingdom are) and they are theſe three:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>It is requiſite, that Laws and Judgements ſhould be perfectly righteous,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The properties of Law.</note> 
                     <hi>and by conſequence unvariable; Such as do binde all Perſons, in all Ages, and in every Nation.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Laws and Judgements (rightly ſo called) according to Scripture, are ſuch as cannot be diſpenſed with by any created power.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Laws of Righteouſneſs and Judgement (ſuch as all Chriſts Laws be) do binde the Spirit and Conſcience, as well as the outward man.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Theſe are the <hi>intrinſccal</hi> Properties of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Judgement,</hi> and they are incommunicable to Humane <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Edicts,</hi> which are many times unrighteous, often mutable, and alwayes imperfect: They neither binde all Perſons, nor in all Ages, nor in every Countrey. 2. They are <hi>diſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> as the experience of all Ages doth teſtifie: Sometimes Higher Powers diſpenſe with them againſt Juſtice; ſometimes Juſtice doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire they ſhould be diſpenſed with, becauſe the Laws themſelves are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt. 3. Humane Laws and Sanctions, do not reach the Spirit and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as all the Laws of Chriſt do. Indeed, when the matter they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, is the ſame which Chriſt hath commanded before, or not contrary, then we are to be ſubject for Conſcience ſake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 5. Yet then, it is the Law of Chriſt, and the homage we owe to him, that obligeth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. But if they command that which is contrary to Chriſt (as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they do) then, as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>Whether it be right in the ſight of God to hearken unto ſuch</hi> (Commands and Commanders) <hi>more then unto God, judge ye,</hi> Acts 4. 19.</p>
               <p>From theſe Arguments we may ſafely conclude, That the Lordly So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Power of <hi>giving Laws and Judgements,</hi> belongs onely to Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> This <hi>Law-giving Power</hi> is ſuch, as Chriſt will not give to another. I may call this, and not unfitly, Gods <hi>Right-hand:</hi> God <hi>never ſaid unto any of the Angels</hi> (nor unto any Man, Chriſt only excepted) <hi>at any time, Sit on my Right-hand,</hi> Heb. 1. 13. to wit, the <hi>Right-hand of the Power of God,</hi> Luke 22. 69. Now the greateſt and moſt Soveraign Power, is, The <hi>Law-giving</hi> Power: It is not a Power fit for holy Angels, much leſs for ſinful men, to have; for that were to ſet them, as I may ſay, at Gods Right-hand.</p>
               <p>And though the Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſince the riſe of the <hi>Beast,</hi> and their reception of power from the Dragon, will not be perſwaded to hearken unto, yet the very Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> will one day riſe up in judgement againſt thoſe which are called Chriſtian Princes and States. I ſhall therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite an Epiſtle of <hi>Eleutherius</hi> the Pope, unto <hi>Lucius</hi> King of <hi>Britain,</hi> as I finde it recorded in Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> Book of Martyrs. And well was it placed in his Book of <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> for it is a ſtrong witneſs which that Biſhop beareth for Chriſt, and for the perfection of Chriſts Laws, againſt the imperfect Laws of Men.</p>

                  <hi>which you may practiſe and put in ure within your Realm. The Roman Laws and the Emperors, we may ever reprove; but the Law of God we may not. Ye have received of late, through Gods Mercy, in the Realm of</hi> Britain, <hi>the Law and Faith of Chriſt: Ye have with you, within the Realm, both parties of the Scriptures. Out of which, by Gods grace, with the Councel of your Realm, take ye a Law, and by that Law (through Gods ſufferance) rule your Kingdom of</hi> Britain. <hi>For you are Gods Vicar in your Kingdom; according to the ſaying of the Pſalm,</hi> Deus judicium tuum regi da, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>O God, give thy judgement to the King, and thy righteouſneſs to the Kings Son,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He ſaid not, The judgement and righteouſneſs of the Emperor; but, Thy judgement and juſtice; that is to ſay, of God. The Kings Sons, be the Chriſtian people and folk of the Realm, which be under your Government, and live and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in peace within your Kingdom, as the Goſpel ſaith: Like as the hen ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers her chickens under her wings, ſo doth the King his people. The people and folk of the Realm of</hi> Britain <hi>be yours; whom if they be divided, you ought to gather in concord and peace: To call them to the Faith and Law of Chriſt, and to the holy Church; to cheriſh and maintain them; to rule and govern them; and to defend them alwayes from ſuch as would do them wrong, from malicious men, and enemies. A King hath his name of Ruling, and not of having a Kingdom. You ſhall be a King while you rule well; but if you do otherwiſe, the Name of a King ſhall not remain with you, and you ſhall loſe it: which God forbid. The Almighty God grant you ſo to Rule the Realm of</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>that you may Reign with him for ever, whoſe Vicar you be in the Realm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Eleutherius</hi> writ this Epiſtle, in the beginning of the third Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, before the Beaſt aroſe, whileſt yet they retained ſome of the Primitive ſimplicity. And his judgement is clear in this point, That the Laws of Chriſt are perfect; and the beſt Humane Laws (for ſuch were the Roman Laws) are imperfect. And we are not to expect righteous Laws and Judgements from the Emperor, or any other Prince or State, but from Chriſt: Whom he owned as a King and Prince, to rule and govern his People by his Laws. Wherefore he alledgeth that ſaying in the Goſpel, and applieth it to the Civil Magiſtrate, who ſhould, like the Hen, gather, and guide, and protect his People, according to the Laws of Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Old and New Teſtament. Oh! what account will the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of <hi>Britain</hi> give to Chriſt, for neglecting ſuch wholeſome counſel as this?

It would be the ſtability of their Thrones and Governments, from one generation to another. This is the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie which Chriſt now hath with this preſent generation, and for which he hath drawn ſo much blood already in many Nations. But moſt terrible and dreadful will that time be, (and it is not long to come) when Chriſt ſhall <hi>come to tread the wine-preſs of the fierceneſs and wrath of Almighty God, and cry to the Angel that had the ſharp ſickle, ſaying, Thruſt in thy ſickle, and gather the cluſters of the Vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe. And the Angel thruſt in his ſickle into the earth, and gathered the Vine of the earth, and caſt it into the great wine-preſs of the wrath of God. And the wine-preſs was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the wine-preſs, even unto the horſe-bridles, by the ſpace of a thouſand and ſix hundred furlongs,</hi> Rev. 14. 18, 19, 20.

               <p>I Anſwer. True, <hi>de facto,</hi> they have done ſo, and they do ſo at this day, in all the ten Nations of the Roman Monarchy: but <hi>quo jure,</hi> by what right do they exerciſe ſuch a power? Let them ſhew their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from Chriſt, if they can: I am ſure we reade not of any ſuch power delegated to the beſt and wiſeſt Princes that ever reigned; neither to <hi>David,</hi> nor to <hi>Solomon,</hi> nor to any of the reſt of the Kings of Judah; and how then can it be imagined, that Wicked and Antichriſtian Princes ſhould have ſuch a power granted unto them by Chriſt? And if not from Chriſt, whence then have they received their power? We heard before, that Jeſus Chriſt received his Power by <hi>Gift</hi> from the Father: But lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> theſe Antichriſtian Princes receive their Power by <hi>Gift</hi> from the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> Rev. 17. 12. <hi>The ten Horns which thou ſaweſt, are ten Kings, which have received no Kingdom as yet, but receive power as Kings one hour with the Beaſt.</hi> And who gave the <hi>Beaſt</hi> his power, and the ten Horns, or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, theirs? Reade you the 13th of the <hi>Rev.</hi> ver. 2. and you ſhall ſee, That the <hi>Dragon</hi> gave the Beaſt his power, and by conſequence he gave the ten Horns or Kingdoms their power alſo, for they both received their power together. This <hi>Dragon,</hi> as we may reade in the 12th Chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> is the Devil. And he did indeed make his boaſt unto Chriſt, that he had ſuch a <hi>power,</hi> to give all the Kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them, to whom he pleaſed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 6. In reſpect whereof he is called, <hi>The god of the World,</hi> Joh. 12. 31.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the unſafe <hi>Tenure,</hi> by which the ten Antichriſtian Kings and Kingdoms hold and exerciſe their power. They have not received it by <hi>Gift</hi> from heaven, but from the Prince of Darkneſs: And how then ſhould it be otherwiſe, but as they have received their power from Satan, ſo they muſt act for him, againſt Chriſt, and againſt his Witneſſes, all the dayes of Antichriſts Reign? Me thinks the conſideration of this Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of their Power, might be a ſtrong Motive or Argument to ſuch of the ten Kingdoms of the Empire, as know moſt of Chriſt, yea unto them all, to throw away, and to renounce all that Power and Authority which they have received from this <hi>Red Dragon,</hi> the Devil, and accept their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments a new from Jeſus Chriſt, under the Broad-Seal of Heaven. I doubt not but I may ſay of ſome that have been chief Rulers of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that had they had ſuch men about them as would have been faithful, to ſhew them the Diabolical <hi>Riſe</hi> of their Power and Juriſdiction out of the Word of God, they would ſoon have renounced all ſuch power, and have ſubmitted themſelves and their Kingdoms unto Jeſus Chriſt, and received their power a new from him.</p>
               <p>2. There is a Miniſterial Power, which is none other, but a power derived by Commiſſion from Chriſt, to <hi>act</hi> and execute the Laws of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Judgement given by him. And this power is committed unto States and Rulers, and all ſorts of Officers, both of higher and lower rank. For this great King, the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> hath many Officers and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:117430:13"/> Miniſters under him, to act and execute righteouſneſs in his Name, and according to his will; and upon them he hath ſet a ſpecial character or image of his Mighty Power, calling them <hi>Gods,</hi> Pſal. 82. 1, 6. Gen. 1. 26.</p>
               <p>Now that I may the better expreſs the full latitude of Miniſterial power, or the Authority which Men and States do or ſhould exerciſe by Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>great King;</hi> Let it be conſidered, That all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtratical Power may be diſtinguiſhed into theſe two kindes, <hi>Deliberative,</hi> and <hi>Active.</hi> The former, to wit, Deliberative Power, belongs unto the great Councel or Repreſentative of a State or Nation, who are be truſted by them, to deliberate about all Matters that concern the Publick Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and Peace of the State; To negotiate with Forraign Princes and States; To conclude of Peace and War; To order the Militia; To im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power fit Officers for the ſervice of the Commonwealth, and to limit their Power; To call all Officers, higher or lower, to an account, and if there be juſt cauſe, to diſplace them. Of which you may reade more at large in Mr. <hi>Collons Abſtract of Laws and Government,</hi> Chap. 1. Sect. 2, 3. This Councel or Repreſentative, are to be choſen by the Saints in all the Tribes or Shires of the Nation, according to the Rules preſcribed in the Word, as appeareth <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 13. compared with <hi>Exod. 24. 1. Numb.</hi> 11. 24. Now what the Number of theſe Councellors ſhall be, or whether one ſhall be Preſident or chief amongſt them, I do not finde it ſtrictly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; nor is it greatly material, ſo be it they be qualified according to the Rule. This Councel or Repreſentative, being the higheſt Power in the Nation, they have Power to direct, and determine, in hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult caſes of Judgement, ſuch as may be tranſmitted to them from inferior Judicatories, <hi>Deut. 17. 8. &amp;</hi> 1. 17. This Power, though it be a Lordly Ruling Power, and higheſt in reſpect of the People and Subjects; yet it is a Miniſterial and Subordinate Power, in reſpect of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the <hi>Law- giver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. There is in every Commonwealth an <hi>Active</hi> Power, which is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute Judgement and Righteouſneſs: And this alſo is a Lordly Ruling Power, but ſubordinate to the former. And ſuch is the <hi>Power</hi> of all Judges and Juſtices, and other inferior Officers, both of higher and lower rank, who in their ſeveral Offices and. Stations, are to do and execute their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Truſts, according to the Laws and Rules of the <hi>Great Law-giver.</hi> And Chriſt hath promiſed, That this ſhall be the ſtate and condition of his people in the <hi>Laſt-times,</hi> when the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhall reign, <hi>Iſaiah 60. 17. I will alſo make thine Officers, Peace; and thine Exactors, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the further clearing of the Magiſtrates power, it would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to inquire into theſe particulars following.</p>

               <p>Which particulars being cleared, we ſhall the better diſcern between that Government which is of Chriſt (committed by him to his Vice gerents on earth) and that which is of the world, and proceeds from that bloody <hi>Dragon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And firſt of the firſt:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt then, I ſhall ſhew you, that Rulers and Magiſtrates (rightly called, according to Chriſts appointment, and by the ſuffrage of the people) receive their power from Chriſt, and have a juſt and warrantable ground for the execution of their ſeveral Functions; whether they be Supreme, as Councellors; or Subordinate, as Judges and Officers, of higher and lower rank. This is evident from that remarkable Example of <hi>Moſes, Deut. 1. 13. Give for your ſelves wiſe men, and underſtanding, and known amongst your Tribes, and I will place them for Rulers over you. Moſes</hi> knew, That Magiſtracy (I mean, that part of Government which conſiſts in ordering the people, and executing the Laws of Judgement and Juſtice amongſt them) was an inſupportable burthen; and therefore finding it too heavy for himſelf alone, he guides the people in a right way, to be ſupplied from time to time, with fit Rulers and Judges, after his deceaſe: knowing full well, that it was not to be expected, that all Officers ſhould have an immediate call from God, as himſelf had. Therefore he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points them to chooſe, and preſent fit perſons to him, and he would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power them. And this he did, not upon his own head, or by the advice of his Father in Law <hi>Jethro,</hi> without direction from Chriſt: For, <hi>Numb. 11. 16. Jehovah ſaid to Moſes, Gather unto me ſeventy men of the Elders of Iſrael, whom thou knoweſt to be the Elders of the people, and Officers over them, and bring them unto the Tabernacle of the Congregation, that they may ſtand there with thee: And I will come down and talk with thee there; and I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and I will put it upon them, and they ſhall bear the burthen of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thy ſelf alone.</hi> This is Chriſts method: The people firſt chuſe the men, then <hi>Moſes</hi> (the Supreme Power in that Commonwealth) approveth and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powereth them; and Chriſt Jeſus qualifieth them with ſutable <hi>Gifts,</hi> and ſpirits them for their places. And how doth Chriſt do that? Behold, when the people have gone as far as they can to Elect, and the Supreme Power hath approved the peoples choice, and granted them Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Then theſe Officers (be they higher or be they lower) they muſt be preſented ſolemnly before Chriſt and his People, in their ſolemn meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (when Chriſt comes to talk with them) either upon the Lords dayes, or upon ſome other day, ſet a part for that occaſion in chief; and the face of God is to be ſought, that he would pour out of his Spirit, to qualifie his Servants with Gifts ſutable to their Calling, Chriſt having received gifts for that end.</p>
               <p>And in this way Chriſt doth confer Magiſtratical Power, and ſutable Gifts, upon Councellors, Rulers, Judges, Officers, and Exactors, from the higheſt to the loweſt; training up his people unto a daily dependence upon him, both to call them forth to Office, and to qualifie them for it.</p>
               <p>But how contrary to this, is the practiſe of the Antichriſtian Nations,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:117430:14"/> which have received their Power from the Dragon? As may appear, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 12, compared with <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 4. What? from the Dragon, you will ſay? Is not all <hi>power</hi> of God? <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1. True, all power, as <hi>power,</hi> is of God; yea, it is an Ordinance of God. To beget children, is a power from God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 2. and it is an Ordinance of God: But to beget chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren upon any, ſaving a mans own wife, is of the Devil. Even ſo in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſe; All <hi>power,</hi> whether Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, is from God: But to receive this power from any hand but Chriſts, and in any other way, is from the Devil. And therefore <hi>John</hi> concludeth, That all the ten Horns, or Kings or Kingdoms, under the Fourth Beaſt or Monarchy, received their Civil Power, as well as the Beaſt received his Eccleſiaſtical Power, from the Dragon; becauſe they received it in the Dragons way, by Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, Oppreſſion, and Uſurpation, as all the other Monarchs had done before them. And hence it is, that the Devil ſaith to Chriſt, <hi>Luke 4. 6. All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them; fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that is delivered unto me,</hi> &amp;c. And Chriſt doth not deny it. It ſeems therefore, the Devil hath a Commiſſion granted him over the Kingdoms of the World, as ſometime he had over <hi>Job</hi> and all his eſtate: And this ſeems to be given him, from the firſt ſetting up of theſe four great Monarchies, to puniſh the unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full world, that would not ſubmit themſelves unto the quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Government of Chriſt, to be ruled by thoſe wholeſome and perfect Laws which he then had given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but utterly overthrew that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Form of Government, when the <hi>Jews</hi> were carried Captive into <hi>Babel.</hi> And ever ſince that time, the Dragon hath challenged and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed this power over the Nations, and they receive their power (both Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and Subordinate) from him, and he ſpirits them for the work: And they oftentimes chooſe carnal and wicked men, perſecutors of the Saints, or at beſt but civil, or ſeemingly religious (but ſeldome ſuch as are ſincere) and being ſo choſen, commend them to the higher powers. And when they are choſen, and have obtained their Commiſſions from the Higher Powers, do they then preſent themſelves before the Lord and his people, to look up to Chriſt, to pour out of his anointing upon them? Nay, rather if they know where ſuch an Aſſembly of people be, they will either perſecute them as Conventicles, or elſe they will come to catch the poor ſervants of Chriſt, and to intrap them in their words, if they can; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, if they be ſuch as preach up the Kingdom of Chriſt: For, that is ſo contrary to the <hi>Dragon,</hi> that it cannot be indured. As for qualification, they think they have enough, if they can but get a Commiſſion under the Seal of Authority. Thus you ſee a vaſt difference, between Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments that receive their power from Chriſt, and thoſe that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred by the Dragon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us conſider, what manner of perſons they be, or ſhould be, that are to be be truſted with Magiſtratical Power; and what the latitude of their Power is. The perſons choſen to Office (eſpecially of higheſt Truſt) ought to be thus qualified. 1. They muſt be ſuch as are in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety<note place="margin">Qualifications of Magiſtrates.</note> with ſome of the Churches of Chriſt rightly conſtituted: How elſe ſhould it be expected, that they will act for Chriſt? And therefore <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Deut. 17. 15. From among thy brethren ſhalt thou ſet a King over
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:117430:15"/> thee.</hi> And <hi>Jer. 30. 21. Their Nobles ſhall be of themſelves, and their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour ſhall proceed out of the midst of them; and I will cauſe him to draw near, and he ſhall approach unto me.</hi> Now <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> both of them, do ſpeak unto the Church of Chriſt: which argueth, That onely ſuch as are in fellowſhip with the Church, ought to be appointed Officers. 2. They muſt be godly men; or, as it is ſaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 21. Men fearing God: Wiſe men, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 13. For, the fear of God is the beginning of wiſdome. 3.

Exod.</hi> 23. 2, 3. 8. They muſt be of a liberal, bountiful ſpirit, given to hoſpitality, <hi>Job 31. 17, 18, 19. I have not eaten my morſel my ſelf alone, and the fatherleſs hath not eaten thereof,</hi> &amp;c. 9. They ought to be pitiful; they ſhould be eyes to the blinde, feet to the lame, a tongue for the dumb, and a father to the poor, <hi>Job 29. 15, 16. Prov.</hi> 31. 8. 10. They muſt be men of Tempeoance, not given to Wine and Women, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 3, 4, 5. 11. They muſt be men of meek ſpirits; ſuch was <hi>Moſes,</hi> Numb. 12. 3. and ſuch ſhould all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates be, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 3. Wherefore God promiſeth his ſpecial guidance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch, when they come to ſit on the Judgement-Seat, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 9. A man of a haſty, raſh, headſtrong ſpirit, is often miſ-led in judgement: And if you reade <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 4. you ſhall ſee, that <hi>David</hi> reckons Meekneſs amongſt the qualifications of a Ruler or Prince.</p>
               <p>Thus you have ſeen the qualifications of ſuch as ſhould be called forth unto higheſt place of Truſt in a Commonwealth, and to the execution of Judgement among the people. And truly, the like qualifications are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in every Officer of loweſt rank; ſaving that they may be choſen out of a lower rank of men, who are not of the like quality and eſtates. And who will not grant, that ſuch men as theſe, are fitteſt to be be truſted with Power and Office in a Commonwealth? But behold! how contrary hereunto is the way of the world? They minde not ſo much the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid qualifications; but if they be ſuch men as can make friends to thoſe in higher Power, and ſuch as can temporize, and pleaſe the humors of the Prince, or chief Ruler of the State, and ſuch as will cry up their Lords Intereſt with open mouth, where-ever they come; then are they fit Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers for the Nations: and ſo it hath been ever ſince they received their Power from the Dragon. They little care for Saintſhip; they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have them ſuch as will Brow-beat the Saints, and diſcourage them; ſuch as will rule over the people of God with rigour, like as the Egyptians did over the Iſraelites.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee a broad difference, between the Government of Chriſt,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:117430:15"/> and the Government exerciſed by the Nations, in reſpect of the Miniſters and Officers of the State, from the higheſt to the loweſt. But ere I paſſe to the next point, conſider the latitude of their power. For be they of higher, or be they of lower rank and place, they may not go beyond the Rules and Laws which Chriſt hath given. Their commiſſions are only to do and execute Juſtice and Judgment, every man according to the quality of his Office: Each man muſt do that, which the juſt Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver hath given him in charge. But now for the Officers of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are not bound to the perfect righteous Laws of Chriſt, but to the unperfect (and many times unjuſt) Laws of men; and according to them they muſt act, though never ſo contrary to the Laws of God. Yea, and many times they do act, and muſt act, according to the wills and pleaſures of their Lords, from whom they receive their power, though quite contrary to the Laws of the Land eſtabliſhed. Thus you ſee a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable difference in reſpect of the latitude of the Officers power in Chriſts Kingdom, and the power of thoſe that are Officers in thoſe Kingdoms that have received their power from the <hi>Dragon.</hi> The one hath the will of Chriſt for their limit, and the other the will of ſinful men, or of Satan.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Come we to conſider the manner of their adminiſtrations, and how<note place="margin">The manner of their admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</note> the Officers in Chriſts Kingdome do execute their power, which I ſhall ſhew in four particulars. <hi>Firſt,</hi> when they come together in their Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories or in their Councels, they begin with prayer and ſeeking the face of God, for his preſence to be with them, and to go along in all their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations. They know that God will be ſanctifyed in all that draw neer to him, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10. 3. They know that every thing is ſanctifyed by the Word of God and Prayer. And as good <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> when he ſent forth Magiſtrates, prayed for them, <hi>The Lord be with the good,</hi> 2 Chro. 19. 11. ſo they think it meet to pray for themſelves, that God would be with them in their Councels, and in their Judgments, and adminiſtrations. And knowing that they are not to judge for man, but for the Lord, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 19. 6. they begin with God. They know it is a heatheniſh practiſe, whether for perſons, or families, or Governments and Judicatories, not to call upon the name of the Lord, <hi>Pſal. 79. 6. Jer.</hi> 10. 25. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in New <hi>England,</hi> they do alwayes begin their Courts, and Councels, and their Military exerciſes, with invocation of the Name of the Lord. <hi>Secondly,</hi> when they have begun with Prayer, like Chriſtians, and ſuch as depend upon God for guidance and direction, then they do hear with all gravity and meekneſs, the cauſes brought before them, as men that are willing to know and underſtand the truth of the matter, ere they conclude or judge of the ſame. Therefore <hi>meekneſs,</hi> is coupled with truth and righteouſneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 4. They do not break jeſts, to make the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal multitude merry, nor do they threaten men, and call them out of their names: But patiently hear the cauſe, and attend to the witneſſes, who give in their Teſtimony upon oath, (eſpecially in weighty caſes,) <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 20. And this is done by lifting up their hands to Heaven, <hi>Dan. 12. 7. And ſwearing by him that liveth for ever;</hi> And not by laying down the hand on a book, as the practiſe of Antichriſt hath been. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:117430:16"/> at the mouth of two or three witneſſes, the Judges do determine the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 6. and 19. 15. We have not one word of a Jury of twelve men, in all the Scripture; but the Judges having heard the cauſe and the Teſtimonies, they give <hi>Judgement</hi> according to the Law; and the party or parties are to ſit down with this <hi>Judgment,</hi> as proceeding from Chriſt, who ſitteth upon the Throne amongſt the Judges. And if any matter prove too difficult for the Judges to determine, then are they to repair unto the great Councel, and to adviſe with them concerning the Law and the Judgment; and the parties muſt ſubmit unto that determination, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 19, 12. There was no appeale allowed, for that would have been a diſhonour to Chriſt, to ſuppoſe his Judgment changeable, like as mens minds and places are. The firſt riſe of ſuch a practiſe, ſeems to ſpring from <hi>Balak,</hi> who when he could not get the Lord to curſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> from one place, thought by changing the place of audience, to change the minde of the Lord. And when that would not prevail, he makes another remove.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nam.</hi> 23. &amp; 24.</note> But it is not ſo in Chriſts Kingdom: When Chriſt gives Judgement, all men are to ſubmit unto it, and ſit down with it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, Chriſts Officers, whether they be Councellors, Judges or Military men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they do conclude their adminiſtrations with praiſes, and Prayer to God. And thus many of Chriſts worthies, in our late warres have done, in their Military expeditions; They have firſt begun with Prayer, and concluded with praiſes. And this is the conſtant practiſe of the Saints in <hi>New England.</hi> When they begin their Courts (whether they be for Councel, or for Judicature) they firſt ſeek the face of God by invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his Name, and conclude in the ſame manner. So alſo do the Military Officers, in their exerciſes. In like manner do the Miniſters and Embaſſadors of Chriſt in their adminiſtrations. For in this way, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Lord to train up all his Servants, (yea thoſe which have attained the greateſt parts) to depend upon him, that he may <hi>act</hi> their Gifts, and make them both ſerviceable and acceptable to himſelf, and to his people.</p>
               <p>But now behold! the great difference between Chriſts <hi>Government,</hi> and the Governments of thoſe Nations that have received their power from the <hi>Dragon.</hi> For 1. When they come to their Councels or Judicatories, they do not begin with Prayer to God: But as Swine which come and gather acornes under the tree, and never look upwards; ſo do they come, and ſit down upon their Judgment-Seats, it may be under the Arms of the Prince or State, which hath impowered them, (and from whence thoſe have received their authority, hath been already ſhewed,) and all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons muſt ſtand bare before them; and in ſtead of Prayer, it may be they begin with an <hi>O yes.</hi> 2. In the management of their power, you ſhall oftentimes ſee, in ſtead of gravity, much levity; The Judges now and then breaking jeſts, to make the carnal auditors to break out into laughter a which doth ill beſeem the Judgment-Seat. Somtimes again they fall into ſuch paſſionate expreſſions, calling men Varlets and Knaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and threatning to make them examples to all others, that a man would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what is become of that meekneſs, which ought to be in righteous Judges. 3. They do not alwayes proceed to Judgment at the mouth of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:117430:16"/> two or three witneſſes, but oftentimes admit ſcores of witneſſes, unto one particular, to ſatisfy the luſts of the plaintiffs and defendants, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Courts fees. Whereas in Chriſts Government, every matter is judged at the mouth of two or three witneſſes at the moſt. And it is an old Maxime, <hi>Fruſtra fit per plura, quod fieri poteſt per pauciora:</hi> it is needleſs to uſe many, when fewer will ſerve the turn. And it were good to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, how it can be excuſed from taking <hi>the Name of God in vain,</hi> if multitude of witneſſes be ſworn. And laſtly, as they do not begin with God, ſo neither do they end and cloſe with God: They ſought not his preſence when they began, nor do they ſeek his bleſſing, nor bleſſe his name for any thing which hath been done. Such is the diſproportion between the Governments of the Nations, and that Government which Chriſt hath ſet up.</p>

                  </label> 
                  <hi>I Anſwer.</hi> 'Tis oftentimes too true, that Councellors and Judges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not <hi>Saints,</hi> more is the pity. They are not <hi>Saints</hi> by calling, nor do they walk in fellowſhip with any of the Churches of Chriſt. It may be they pray not at home in their Families, or in their cloſets, and how then can it be expected, they ſhould pray upon the Judgement-Seats, or in their Counſels? It may be they cannot pray at all, (<hi>quoad verba</hi>) unleſs they ſhould <hi>Mumble</hi> over a company of beads, as the Popiſh manner is. And whereas the Objection ſaith, <hi>it is not the faſhion of the Nations to pray upon Judgment-Seats,</hi> &amp;c. I Anſwer, It is the more ſhame for them: But yet no wonder, that in thoſe Nations which have received their power from the <hi>Dragon,</hi> Prayer unto God ſhould grow out of uſe, for that would not turn to the <hi>Dragons</hi> advantage. 2. As it is a ſhame for them, ſo it is to be pityed and lamented, that Nations who profeſſe Chriſt, ſhould have ſuch Officers, as are difuſed to pray, and either cannot or will not call upon God. 3. I ſay, that though Rulers in other Nations do not make it their buſineſs to ſeek the Lord, both firſt and laſt, in all their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick adminiſtrations; Yet <hi>New-England,</hi> which hath been better prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled, (and let it be remembred for an everlaſting praiſe unto them, in the generations yet to come,) they make this their conſtant practiſe, to begin and end their Courts with prayer. And me thinks the Counſellors and Judges in all the Nations, that profeſſe to know Chriſt, ſhould be willing without much provocation, to take up ſuch a Holy, Neceſſary, and Chriſtian practiſe. For if Maſters be counted irreligious, that pray not with their Families; and Miniſters alſo, that pray not with their Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations; ſhall not ſuch Magiſtrates be worthily counted irreligious, that do not ſanctify Gods Name by Prayer and Praiſes, on their Judgement-Seats? As for ſuch as cannot pray, they are unworthy (me thinks) to ſit upon Gods Seat of Juſtice. It were fit to thruſt ſuch dumb Doggs that cannot bark, ſuch Idol-Shepherds, from the Judgment-Seats, as well as out of the Churches. I ſpeak now of them that are the worſer ſort of Rulers and Magiſtrates, in the ten Kingdomes of the <hi>Romane Monarchie,</hi> which in regard of their conſtituting parts, are mixt, part <hi>iron,</hi> part <hi>clay;</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:117430:17"/> and have received their Authority from the <hi>Dragon.</hi> And truly, the better part will find, that they will not be able to <hi>Act</hi> valiantly for Chriſt, ſo long as their power is founded upon ſuch an unſafe bottome, as hath been ſhewed. 4. Conſider the ſcope and end of <hi>Magiſtrates adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> under the <hi>Government</hi> of Chriſt, and under the Governments of the Nations; and the difference betwixt both.

But they prohibit the Prophets of God, and will not ſuffer them to ſpeak out, <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 13. and ſometimes they mock ſuch Prophets, and miſuſe them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 16. yea ſometimes they threaten them, 2 <hi>Chron. 25. 16. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, why ſhouldeſt thou be ſmitten?</hi> Sometimes they alſo impriſon them; as <hi>Ahab</hi> impriſoned <hi>Micaiah, 2 Chron.</hi> 18. 26. The Princes impriſoned <hi>Jeremie,</hi> Jer. 37. 15. and 38. 6. <hi>Herod</hi> impriſoned <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> Mat. 14. 3. Act. 12. 4. The high Prieſts impriſoned <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 5. 18. The Magiſtrates of <hi>Philippi</hi> impriſoned <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> Act. 16. 23. Or elſe they whip them as they did <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> Act. 16. 23. &amp; the Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 40. Sometimes they caſt them into the Lions den, as the Princes did <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan. 6. 16. And ſometimes they kill them, as <hi>Herod</hi> did <hi>James,</hi> Acts 12. 2. And as for theſe worldly Rulers, they have other ends in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of their power, reſpecting themſelves; namely, to fill their purſes: For ſo it is ſaid of <hi>Feſtus, that he hoped money ſhould have been given him of</hi> Paul, <hi>that he might looſe him; Wherefore he ſent for him the oftner, and communed with him,</hi> Acts 24. 26. Yet he detained <hi>Paul</hi> above two years in the Priſon. From whence we may by the way take notice of the Romiſh practiſe, of keeping the Saints in Priſon, under pretence of high Offences; neither bringing them to a Legal tryal, nor yet releaſing them: Which ſometimes ſprings from covetouſneſs, becauſe they expect a <hi>bribe.</hi> And ſuch a covetous diſtemper <hi>Hoſea</hi> complains of in the Princes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Hoſ. 4. 18. <hi>Her rulers with ſhame love, Give ye;</hi> So our Tranſlators read the words.

Take it in whether ſence you will, and it manifeſts an ill diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in thoſe Worldly Rulers towards their Subjects; who ſhould have been a protection to them, but were not. I never read this title Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, or ſhield, given to any juſt and righteous Magiſtrates in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but to ſuch as theſe wicked Rulers, that by their Military power im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bondaged their Brethren: Which may be the reaſon of their name: For ſometimes they take away the Subjects propriety by force; becauſe it is in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:117430:17"/> the power of their hand. So did wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> and ſome of the wicked Princes of <hi>Judah</hi> that followed his ſteps, <hi>Mich. 2. 1, 2. They covet fields, and take by violence; and houſes, and take them away; So they oppreſs (or defraud) a man, a man and his heritage.</hi> And Iſai. 5. 8. <hi>Woe unto them that joyn houſe to houſe, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midſt of the Land. In mine ears, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, Of a truth many houſes ſhall be deſolate, even great and fair without an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</hi> Sometimes again theſe Worldly Rulers do improve their power, more for their own oſtentation, then to relieve the oppreſſed, <hi>Act. 25. 23. And on the morrow when</hi> Agrippa <hi>was come, and</hi> Bernice <hi>with great pompe, and was entred into the place of hearing, with the Chief Captains and principal men of the City; at</hi> Feſtus <hi>commandment,</hi> Paul <hi>was brought forth.</hi> But what Juſtice was done the poor Priſoner? We read not a word of that. <hi>Feſtus</hi> commanded him again to Priſon, when he ſaw <hi>Paul</hi> came not off with a gift.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee a vaſt difference between the Rulers of this World, under the Prince of darkneſs, and the Rulers which Chriſt hath inſtituted. Both in the <hi>Power,</hi> the exerciſe, and in the <hi>Author</hi> of their power, and in the <hi>quality</hi> of the perſons exerciſing that power, and in the <hi>latitude</hi> of their power, and in the <hi>manner</hi> of their adminiſtration, as alſo in the <hi>Scope and end</hi> of the ſame. It will not be amiſſe, to ſhew briefly the <hi>effects</hi> of theſe Governments; and the ſtability of the one, and inſtability of the other, before we come to conſider of the Laws of Chriſts Kingdome.</p>
               <p>The <hi>effects</hi> of Chriſts Government, are briefly, yet fully, expreſſed by the Prophet, <hi>Iſai. 32. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. Then Judgement ſhall dwell in the Wilderneſs, and righteouſneſs in the fruitful field. And the work of righteouſneſs ſhall be peace; and the effect of righteouſneſs, quietneſs and aſſurance for ever. And my people ſhall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in ſure dwellings, and in quiet reſting places; When it ſhall hail plentifully upon the foreſt, and the City ſhall be throughly humbled. Bleſſed are they that ſow beſides all waters, that ſend forth the feet of the Ox and the Aſs.</hi> And Iſa. 65. 25. <hi>The Wolf &amp; the Lamb ſhall feed together, and the Lion ſhall eate ſtraw like a Bullock, and duſt ſhall be the Serpents meat.</hi> But now behold! the effects of worldly Governments, and their unrighteous adminiſtrations. They make the Servants of God to cry to him, becauſe of their bondage and ſervitude, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 23, 24. &amp; if they do but groane and ſigh, God heareth it. The Souls from under the Altar cry, <hi>How long O Lord! Holy and True, doſt thou not judge and avenge our blood them that dwell upon the Earth,</hi> Rev. 6. 10. Yea, the <hi>impriſonments</hi> of the Saints do cry aloud to God, <hi>and he looſeth the Priſoners,</hi> Pſa. 146. 7. And if men will not do it, when they have power in their hands, God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it very ill, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 14. 16, 17, &amp;c. <hi>Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, and did ſhake Kingdomes? that made the World a Wilderneſs, and deſtroyed the Cities thereof? that opened not the houſe of his Priſoners? All the Kings of the Nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own houſe: But thou art caſt out of thy grave, as an abominable branch, as the garment of thoſe that are ſlain, and thruſt through with the Sword: that go down to the ſtones of the pit, as a carkastrodden under feet. Thou ſhalt not be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them in burial, becauſe thou haſt deſtroyed thy Land, ſlain thy people: the feed of evil doers ſhall not be renowned for ever. Prepare ſlaughter for his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:117430:18"/> Children, for the iniquity of their Fathers: they ſhall not riſe, nor poſſeſs the Land, nor fill the face of the world with cryes</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. <hi>Watchmen, or Courts of guard.</hi>
                  </note> I know this Propheſy is ſpoken firſtly againſt the King of <hi>Babylon;</hi> but they are of weighty conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, unto all the Princes and Rulers of this World, eſpecially unto thoſe, that are parts and members of myſtical <hi>Babylon,</hi> in caſe they lift up themſelves againſt the people of God, and caſt them into Priſons, and detain them there, as ſundry Saints have been amongſt us of late.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee unrighteouſneſs in Government fills the Land with cryes, and that unſettles the Government, and at length will overturn it. It firſt maketh diviſion, and diviſion bringeth deſolation: As we may ſee in the Story of <hi>Abimelech</hi> and <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> Judg. 9. and 1 King. 12. 16, 18. Whereas on the contrary, the righteouſneſs of Chriſts Government worketh peace and quietneſs, and from thence becomes permanent and durable, or as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>it hath no end.</hi>

                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:117430:19"/>2. If a mans Ox or beaſt, gore, bite or kill a mans Son or Servant, the beaſt ſhall dye, and the owner (in caſe he knew his beaſt was wont to do ſo) ſhall either be put to death, or pay ſuch fine as ſhall be laid upon him by the Judges, with conſent of the party wronged, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 28, 29.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If a mans beaſt ſhall kill another mans beaſt, and the owner knew that his beaſt was wonted to puſh, then ſhall he make full reſtitution in kind, or at leaſt in value: elſe the parties ſhall each bear a ſhare in the loſſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 35, 36.</p>

                  <p>Theſe are the principal caſes which I find in Scripture: but if any other be found which is here omitted, let the ingenuous Reader add it to the number. As for Common ſwearing and drunkenneſs, I find not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe puniſhment; yet being brutiſh ſins, as alſo common whoredome is, they are puniſhable with the uſual puniſhments of a beaſt. And if they prove incorrigible, then there is a Law to cut them off by death. Now the perfection of theſe Laws of Chriſts Kingdom appears, 1. By the equity of them, they are moſt juſt: 2. By the comprehenſiveneſs of them; for though they be but few in number, yet may be extended in the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them, by way of proportion, unto all caſes and actions, that do or can fall out, at Sea or at Land; all circumſtances being duly weighed, and rightly applyed. 3. By the extent of them, which reacheth all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in all ages, and in all Nations. For unrighteouſneſs, is unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as well in one perſon, as in another; as well in one age and in one Nation, as in another. And by conſequence, as unrighteouſneſs is one and the ſame, ſo alſo muſt the Judgment and the puniſhment be: And the reaſon thereof, ſpringeth from the unchangeable Nature of Chriſt, who is the ſame to day, Yeſterday and for ever.</p>
                  <p>Again, theſe Laws and Judgments, cannot be altered or changed, by any created power; in regard of the Divine Original of them. Whence alſo it comes to paſſe, that they have a binding power over conſcience.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould now come to compare the Laws of men, with theſe Laws of Chriſt; and to ſhew the righteouſneſs and equity of the one, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs and iniquity of the other. But if I ſhould enter into parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, I ſhould both weary my ſelf and the Reader. Let it ſuffice to give a taſte of ſome few.</p>
                  <p>Chriſts Law makes it death to worſhip Idols. Mens Laws make it death not to worſhip Idols. And how many faithful Servants of Chriſt, have ſuffered Martyrdom, even in theſe Nations, upon this Account?</p>
                  <p>Again, Gods Law ſaith, a Thief ſhall make double reſtitution unto the party wronged, or be ſold. Mens Laws ſay they ſhall be hanged. And what equity is there in it, that the life of a man ſhould go for thirteen
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:117430:19"/> pence half penny, or a greater ſumme? Or what recompence will that be to the party wronged? Chriſts Law ſaith, If a man lye with a marryed Woman, he and ſhe ſhall dye. Mens Laws ſay they ſhall ſtand in a white ſheet. Or if they do make it death to commit adultery, yet they muſt be found (as they uſe to ſpeak) <hi>rem in re,</hi> which cannot well be proved, unleſs the parties will confeſſe againſt their own lives. Again, Chriſts Law alloweth any of the Sons of men, to live in any place, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they commit not ſome capital ſin, that deſerveth cutting off: But Mens Laws (at leaſt in ſome places) do make it death for a Jew to live amongſt them: When yet Jeſuites, and Seducers to Idolatry, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of ſtrange Gods, can find allowance. Moreover, Chriſts Law gives all the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> a kind of Lordſhip over the Creature: But Mens Laws reſtrain that liberty, making ſome kind of fowls, the Kings game only; forbidding others to meddle with them, under ſuch and ſuch penalties. Again, Chriſts Law gives the eldeſt Son the birth-right of inheritance, and alloweth him a double portion: But Mens Laws ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times give the yongeſt Son the birth-right, and ſometimes allows all the Sons to inherit alike; And ſometimes again gives all the Lands unto the eldeſt, and puts off the yonger Children with ſmall and inconſiderable portions, to make the eldeſt Son a Gentleman. Furthermore, Chriſts Law is very tender of the ſubjects liberty, and impriſoneth no man, but only for matter of fact, and that to ſecure them, (where other ſecurity cannot be had) until the firſt opportunity of hearing and tryal, which was not to be delayed: But men will impriſon others without matter of fact, as we ſee <hi>Joſeph</hi> was impriſoned in <hi>Aegypt:</hi> So alſo was <hi>Paul</hi> (when yet the Rulers confeſſed, he might have been ſet at liberty, for any matter of fact that they could charge him with,) and there he was kept in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for two whole years and more. Again, Chriſts manner was, to proclaim war before he make war; but the Rulers of the World, can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin war, and proclaim it afterwards. Now what a wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For much might be done, in this reſpect, and as I conceive ſafely, if it were meet for me to ſpeak. But I ſhall briefly wind up all in a few words of application in the general, as my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod is.</p>

For information, that the Doctrine of the fifth Kingdom or Monarchy, is no Novelty; no Fancy, no Childiſh nor ridiculous opinion, as ſome unadviſedly ſpeak: But (to uſe the words of him that Rules in Chief, unto Mr. <hi>Tillinghaſt</hi>) it is a moſt glorious truth. For <hi>Daniel</hi> tells us that in the dayes of the fourth Kingdom or Monarchy, eſpecially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the ſame, God will raiſe up ſuch a Kingdom as cannot be deſtroyed, which is that <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Chriſt, or <hi>World to come,</hi> wherein

                  <p>As touching the time, and ſome other circumſtances, I know good men do differ; and they may without Offence to a good conſcience, or to the Truth, allow to each other their different apprehenſions.

So did <hi>Joſeph</hi> under <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Gen. 41. 40. <hi>Obadiah</hi> under <hi>Ahab,</hi> a wicked Prince, and an uſurper, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 3, 4, 13. <hi>Daniel</hi> under <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and <hi>Darius,</hi> Dan. 2. 48. and 6. 1. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> under <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> Neh. 2. 1. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi> under <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> Eſth. 8. 2, 9, 15. <hi>Cornelius</hi> under the Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 1.</p>
                  <p>Yea, there were Saints in <hi>Caeſars</hi> houſe, Phil. 4. 22. All which places do evidently ſhew, that Saints may officiate, under wicked and Prophane Princes and Rulers. And the reaſon is clear; For <hi>there is no Power but of God,</hi> Rom. 13. 1. And God would not have his Servants ſo ſtraitned in their Spirits, as not to Act righteouſly, under an unrighteous Ruler, ſo long as they may Act for him and for his people; or not againſt them. Beſides, it may be greatly to the honour of God, and for the good and comfort of his people, that ſuch are advanced: As we ſee, in thoſe examples of <hi>Obadiah, Daniel, Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who honoured God by their faithfulneſs, and did many good Offices for the people of God. And experience hath learned many wicked Princes, that there be none ſo ſit for publick truſt, none ſo faithful, as they. Which redounds much to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But I know ſome godly minds may ſcruple this point, out of a Holy fear and jealouſie, leſt they ſhould partake with evil Rulers in their ſin, eſpecially now, that Romiſh <hi>Babylon</hi> is ſhortly to be deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This tenderneſs of Spirit, (which ſome out of malignancy, count frowardneſs, or worſe) ought not to be diſcouraged by any, in higher or lower ranke. For it proceeds from a good principle; namely, faithfulneſs to God. And truly none ſo fit, nor any ſo like to be faithful to men, as thoſe who are faithful to God. Therefore to remove the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of their ſtumbling, let me commend this to their conſideration, That it is not my acting by their Commiſſion, that makes me communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in their ſins, but compliance with them in Acts of unrighteouſneſs; according as it is written, <hi>The Soul that ſins ſhall dye: the Son ſhall not bear the iniquity of the Father, neither ſhall the Father bear the iniquity of the Son; the righteouſneſs of the righteous ſhall be upon him, and the wickedneſs of the wicked ſhall be upon him,</hi> Ezek. 19. 20, 25. God doth neither impute the ſin of Chief Rulers unto them that are ſubordinate, nor the ſin of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Rulers unto thoſe that rule in chief, ſo be it they do not allow, or imitate, the ſins each of other. The Lord doth not judge that equal. And ſhould it be otherwiſe, it would not be ſafe for any in any age, to Act
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:117430:21"/> in higher or ſubordinate place. This was the Judgement of thoſe good men afore-mentioned. Yet if you may not Act juſt and righteous things without ingagements, ſuch as will expoſe you to participation in their wickedneſs, then ſeparate from them, and have nothing to do with them.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the bearing of Office under uſurping powers, eſpecially now that Antichriſts Kingdome is about to expire, may ſeem to be an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of Antichriſts power, and a retarding of Chriſts work, which is the deliverance of his people out of <hi>Babel;</hi> I conceive it is a miſtake: for a man to act, or Officiate righteouſly in his place, cannot poſſibly uphold <hi>Babel,</hi> or hinder Chriſts work. <hi>Daniel</hi> did bear office not only under <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> but alſo under <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> a moſt debauſhed Prince; yea, at ſuch a time, when <hi>Babylon</hi> was to be deſtroyed and ruined, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 29. And who more fit to be advanced, then he; when <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> came to deliver the People of God from Tyranny &amp; oppreſſion? The rule and power he did bear, was ſo far from upholding <hi>Belſhazzars</hi> Tyrannical power, or retarding the deliverance of Gods people out of <hi>Babels</hi> that it rather furthered the ſame. Thus much I thought good to write, partly for ſatisfaction of ſuch godly and tender conſciences, as may ſcruple the Lawfulneſs of acting under Antichriſtian and Tyrannical Rulers; and partly to vindicate thoſe, who are Aſſertors of the fifth Monarchy, from the Calumnie caſt upon them, as if they were ill principled men, and ſuch as were adverſaries, to this, or to that Government. Whereas the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is moſt true, that they are the beſt and trueſt friends unto Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and count it their duty to be faithful unto their truſt, be the Rulers what they may, or the form of Government what it will. Only they take themſelves bound in Conſcience to rebuke ſin, and bear witneſs againſt unrighteouſneſs, in any perſon, of what quality ſoever, and in any form of Government whatſoever. And for that cauſe, they are aſperſed by evil minded men, who willingly and wittingly pervert their honeſt and upright meanings, that ſo they may inſinuate themſelves with Rulers and Governours in States, to gain favour and promotion, which is the ſcope they aime at, and ſo trample the Servants of Chriſt under foot. Yea, ſometime thoſe that have cryed up the Kingdome of Chriſt, and decryed all Tyrannical oppreſſing powers in their publick declamations, do face about; and fall bitterly upon fifth Monarchy men, comparing them to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leiden,</hi> and the Anabaptiſts at Munſter, and to Quakers, and Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But let ſuch as can turn about to the times, and change their Doctrine and Judgement, as men do their appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, conſider what Councel <hi>Solomon</hi> giveth his Son, <hi>Prov 24. 21. My Son, fear thou</hi> Jehovah, <hi>and the King; and middle not with them that are given to change. For their Calamity ſhall riſe ſuddenly, and who knoweth the ruine of both?</hi> They pretend the fear of God, and honour of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; but in concluſion, they finde acceptance neither from the one, nor from the other.</p>

                  <p>For the firſt, (and indeed the Chiefeſt place that can be objected) cut of <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 10. it proves the point moſt ſtrongly, that the Law-giving power belongs only to Chriſt, and to none other.

                     </note> word doth ſometimes ſignify the Royal Scepter, or power of <hi>Government;</hi> but I do not find it uſed in all Scripture above five or ſix times in that ſence. And it is but a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed ſpeech, alluding to the cuſtome of Princes, who bear a rod in their hand as an Emblem of their power and authority; which we call a Scepter, to diſtinguiſh it from other Rods. But commonly that word is rendred a <hi>Tribe,</hi> and in the plural Number it is never uſed otherwiſe. Now <hi>Jacobs</hi> meaning in this Prophecie, is not to ſpeak of the Royal Scepter, and power of Government, as appears from hence: For 1. he ſaith it ſhall not depart from <hi>Judah.</hi> Which implies, that the thing of which he Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied had a <hi>Being</hi> at that time when he ſpake thoſe Words. But we find no ſuch ruling power in the hands of that tribe, when <hi>Jacob</hi> ſpake the Words of this Prophecie; but rather in the hands of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who was Ruler over them all. Nor did <hi>Judah</hi> obtain this ruling power, for many hundred years after. Whilſt they continued in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> they were all Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards, <hi>Moſes</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> ruled; and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Ephraim. Gideon</hi> and <hi>Abimelech,</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Manaſſeh. Tola,</hi> of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:117430:22"/> tribe of <hi>Iſſachar. Jephte,</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Manaſſeh. Ibzan</hi> and <hi>Elon,</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Zebulon. Sampſon,</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Dan. Eli</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Levi.</hi> And only <hi>Othniel</hi> (of all the Judges) was of the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> that I remember. So that the ruling power was never ſeated in that tribe until <hi>Davids</hi> time; and that continued not much above four hundred years. For after the Captivity, the Scripture mentions not any one of that tribe that I remember, that had the Government, but <hi>Zoroba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel. Iudas Macchabeus</hi> was of the tribe of <hi>Levi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As <hi>Iudah</hi> obtained no ſuch ruling power, (above the other tribes) until <hi>Davids</hi> time, ſo neither did that Regal power continue with that tribe until <hi>Shiloh</hi> came. And therefore that cannot be the meaning of <hi>Iacob</hi> in his bleſſing, that <hi>Iudah</hi> ſhould hold the Scepter until Chriſt came. But <hi>Iacobs</hi> true meaning is, that God would take ſuch a ſpecial care of that tribe, above all others, to preſerve them from mixture and confuſion (as it befell the ten tribes long before the coming of the Meſſiah) to the end that it might be truly diſcerned, how Chriſt Jeſus deſcended lineally of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> according to the fleſh, his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mary</hi> being of the Royal Seed.</p>
                  <p>And when <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaith, <hi>nor a Law-giver from between his feet, till</hi> Shiloh <hi>come,</hi> he ſtrongly denies all <hi>Law-giving</hi> power unto any that ſhould be born of that tribe, until <hi>Shiloh,</hi> to wit, the Meſſiah did come.

                  <p>This phraſe <hi>from between his feet,</hi> doth alſo imply, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> the Law-giver, ſhould deſcend of the tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> by the Mother, and not by the Father. For had he been to be born after the ordinary manner of generation, he would have ſaid, <hi>out of his loins,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 11. and 46. 26. <hi>Exod. 1. 5. 1 King. 8. 19. Heb.</hi> 7. 5.</p>
                  <p>As to that place, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 18. it rather proves Chriſt himſelf to be the Law-giver; as indeed he was, when he gave the Law to <hi>Moſes</hi> his Servant, on Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> For here at <hi>Beer,</hi> the Lord ſpake to <hi>Moſes, Gather the people together</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and I will give them water.</hi> It was Chriſt that appointed them, and appointed his Servant <hi>Moſes,</hi> to call the people together for that purpoſe; yea, Chriſt himſelf wrought with them, and they digged with him. Elſe, had not Chriſt been Chief in the work, they might long have digged with their ſtaves, and ſung unto it with their voyce, ſaying, <hi>Spring up, O Well!</hi> if Chriſt the Law-giver, had not given ſuch a Law unto the Water to ſpring up there. As for thoſe places in the Pſalms, where <hi>Judah is called the Law-giver,</hi> they only ſhew, that the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Law-giver, ſhould deſcend of that tribe. Therefore, as <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith in the place fore-alledged, ſo I alſo do conclude, that <hi>there is one Law-giver,</hi> who is able to ſave and to deſtroy; and none elſe but one. For as the Lord ſaith in a caſe not much unlike, reaſoning againſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:117430:23"/> Idols, to prove them no Gods; Let them declare things paſt and things to come, and then let them be owned for Gods, elſe not. And he counts it a ſtrong plea, or convincing argument, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 41. 21, 23. So may I ſay in this caſe, let there be produced a man, or a State, that is able to ſave and to deſtroy, and let him have power to give Laws; Elſe let it lye upon his ſhoulder only, upon whom the Father hath laid it. And me thinks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifyed Reaſon might convince us, that there can be but one Law-giver. For ſhould there be imagined, two <hi>Law-givers</hi> or more at the ſame time, their Laws muſt either be one and the ſame; and then what need of two? (For, <hi>fruſtra fit per plura, quod ſieri poteſt per pauciora,</hi>) Or elſe thoſe Laws given by them, will differ, and (like two lines that are not parallels) they will thwart each other at length; and that is contrary to the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of righteouſneſs; which is alwayes right, and nowhere croſſeth or thwarteth with it ſelf. I would not have added this Uſe, but that there be ſo many, that do claim a part with Jeſus Chriſt, to make Laws. But if they will grant him power to make <hi>Moral</hi> Laws, which Univerſally oblige all the Sons of men, why ſhould not he have a like power and right to make <hi>Iudicials?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2, If the power of <hi>civil Government</hi> be laid upon the ſhoulder of Jeſus Chriſt, and none can have any Lawful power except it be derived from him, as it hath been fully proved: Then this ſhews us, that all the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments in the World, eſpecially thoſe ten Kingdoms under the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Monarchy (whether they wreſt it out of Chriſts hand by force, or receive it from the <hi>Dragon,</hi>) are all of them Antichriſtian; that is, they are adverſaries and enemies unto the Royal power and dignity of Jeſus Chriſt; and cannot be otherwiſe: For as their Conſtitution is againſt Chriſt, ſo muſt needs their execution of that power be. And therefore we may not wonder, that ever ſince the reign of Antichriſt, the ten Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that Empire, have been for the moſt part, enemies unto Chriſts ſincere Servants, and have perſecuted them from poſt to pillar, torturing them with moſt exquiſite torments, as Stories do plentifully teſtify. Yea, the very beſt <hi>Governments</hi> and Governours that have been, have done many bad Offices to the people of God, and ſometimes been cruel and bloody. We may rather wonder that they have been no worſe: For if Chriſt would have permitted the <hi>Dragon</hi> to have had his will, he would have rooted out the very name of Iſrael from off the earth, long ere this. But, though Chriſt (for the puniſhment of the unthankful World, that would not ſubmit to his <hi>Government</hi>) hath given the Devil permiſſion to rule as the God of the World, until the end of Antichriſts reign; yet ſtill, Chriſt hath limited and reſtrained his rage and wrath; Partly, for the preſervation of humane ſociety; but chiefly, for the good of his choſen people.</p>
                  <p>Hence it comes to paſſe that Chriſt ſometimes raiſeth up ſuch Rulers, as become more favourable and propitious to his Churches; as <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> and ſome others after him. And in theſe Nations, we have had <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who for the moſt part were favourable to the Saints. Yet now and then, the very beſt of them, have proved as broken reeds, and been as goads and pricks in the ſides of Holy men, to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:117430:23"/> ſhew ſome tang of the <hi>Dragons</hi> poyſon, from whom they did receive their power at firſt. And now in our dayes, when the little horne is beheaded, and we have nothing left but a ſtinking Carcas; we need not wonder that the Saints are impriſoned, and worſe dealt withall then in the dayes of the moſt wicked and prophane Princes. For what can be expected from a rotten putrifying Carcas after the Soul or Life is departed, but noiſome filthy ſmells and ſavours? Yea, thus it will be, and it cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, until this Carcas be reduced unto duſt, and become as the duſt of the Summer threſhing-floor. There is no hopes of purging a dead and putrifying Carcas, till it be reſolved to duſt. The conſideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, may give juſt occaſion to all Governments in the World, that have any ſpark of love to Chriſt, to be very careful whom they improve, in place of power and authority: That the perſons be godly, and qualified as hath been before declared, according to the mind of Chriſt; Elſe, they may be ſure, they will neither be friends to Chriſt, nor to his people; but the more power they have, the more miſchief they will do. And though they be ſelect and choiſe men, yet (whilſt the old foundations be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and a new one laid, to wit, Jeſus Chriſt, as King and <hi>Law-giver</hi> in the Common-wealth as well as in the Church,) they will not be able to act vigorouſly for Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Again, as the Governments of the World are not friends, but enemies to Chriſt, and his Kingdom; ſo neither are they good friends unto Juſtice and judgment; nor indeed can be. For when Rulers and Governours are unrighteous, and the Laws by which they Governe are unrighteous alſo, or at the beſt imperfect; how can it be expected, that Judgement and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſhould find a place in the World? We may rather expect (what in experience we find to be true,) that there ſhould be all manner of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, either done, or ſuffered to be done in all Nations of the World, both about <hi>Meum &amp; tuum,</hi> mens private intereſts, and publick intereſts of States alſo. So that if Chriſt did not over-rule the Rulers and Governments of the World, (even the worſt of the Nations,) in the exerciſe and uſe of their power, (out of a reſpect unto his choſen ones) men would undoubtedly become as Bears and Lyons, Wolves, Tygres and Leopards, renting, tearing and deavouring one another. Such is the miſerable depravation of mankind, and ſuch is the wrath and rage of that old red <hi>Dragon,</hi> who hath given his power unto the Nations, and for the moſt part, unto carnal and wicked men, that it would be no living in the World. Me thinks if this were duly conſidered, and weighed in the Scales of ſound reaſon, it might be enough to perſwade all the Sons of men, that deſire to enjoy their own proprieties without exactions and oppreſſion from higher powers, to be willing to ſubmit unto the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, quiet and peaceable <hi>Government</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt; Whoſe Laws are all righteous and perfect, and his Judges and Officers Holy and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, when choſen according to his mind and will, as hath been ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>Let this ſuffice for information: and if it were my place, and that I had a calling thereunto, and if mens ears were opened to hear, I might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it profitably for exhortation and admonition alſo. For though it be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:117430:24"/> not to be expected, that any of the Nations will ſet up this Kingdom of Chriſt in the glory thereof, until the Jews be called, to whom it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, <hi>Mich.</hi> 4. 8. that <hi>unto them ſhall come the firſt Dominion;</hi> yet much might be done by the Gentile Nations in order hereunto, as preparatory to ſuch a glorious work, and that without detriment unto the publick peace and tranquillity of the State, if God were pleaſed to give hearts unto men in Chiefeſt place of power, to ſet their hearts and hands unto the work: But becauſe it is hard to ſpeak without Offence in theſe evil dayes, which will not indure wholſome reproof, I ſhall forbear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know God hath a purpoſe to deſtroy them; and leave it unto them, to whom it belongs, to conſider what Chriſt calls for at their hands, and to make more particular application of this <hi>truth,</hi> for their own quickning unto the work. And ſo I come, in the next place, to a word of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> For examination; Seeing the Government is laid upon Chriſts ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and all power and authority that is exerciſed in the World, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, either from Chriſt or from the <hi>Dragon,</hi> it will behove them that are in place of power, to examine, whether the power they exerciſe, be from Chriſt, or from Satan: For which end, I ſhall lay down ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of both. Firſt therefore, let it be examined, whether the <hi>power</hi> you exerciſe be of Chriſt; Which you may diſcerne by theſe two things. 1. By the manner of your reception of your power. 2. By your exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the ſame. For the firſt, to wit, the reception of your power, you are to know, that Chriſt deriveth power and authority unto his Servants theſe three wayes. 1. By immediate call from Heaven: <hi>Come, and I will ſend thee,</hi> ſaith the Lord to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 3. 10. So he ſaid to <hi>Gideon, Go in this thy might,</hi> Jud. 6. 14. In like manner the Lord ſaid to <hi>Samuel, Ariſe, anoint David,</hi> 1 Sam. 16. 13. Which being granted to <hi>David</hi> by way of inheritance from the Lord, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 12. his poſterity do ſucceed in his Throne, without any further expreſſe call from Chriſt. 2. Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riveth power and authority to his Servants, by the free election of his people; and ſo were the Rulers and Judges choſen, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 13. And 3. when his people are oppreſſed and ſpoiled, and cry to God, then he is pleaſed to raiſe up ſome inſtrument or other to deliver them, <hi>Judg.</hi> 2. 16. And this God doth by Spiriting them for ſuch a ſervice, at ſuch a time; as it is ſaid, of <hi>Othniel,</hi> Judg. 3. 10. And the Spirit of Jehovah was upon him, and he judged Iſrael, and went out to war. Sometimes, and I conceive ordinarily, the people of God do call them hereunto, as we ſee in the example of <hi>Jephthath,</hi> Judg. 11. 6. <hi>They ſaid unto</hi> Jephthah, <hi>Come and be our Captain.</hi> They are not choſen by a private <hi>Juncto</hi> of their own creation, which (when they have contrived a muſh-room Government of their own) will ſay and do any thing for their new Lords, that they may do for them again. This is not Chriſts Method; but he allowes his people a free choiſe of their Rulers. And theſe are all the wayes that I find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by which Chriſt deriveth power and authority unto men: Indeed, the bounds and limits of this power, (I mean the ſubjects of this Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction) may be inlarged by a Lawful war, which is alwayes defenſive, as that of the Iſraelites, againſt <hi>Sihon</hi> and <hi>Og,</hi> Numb. 21. 23. and that of <hi>David,</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:117430:24"/> againſt the <hi>Ammonites, 2 Sam.</hi> 10. 7, 17. Secondly, you may diſcern whether the power be of Chriſt, by the actings and exerciſe of your power. If you protect the people of God from the injuries put upon them by carnal men, and defend the poor and fatherleſs, and deliver the poor and needy, <hi>Iob 29. 12. Pſal. 82. 3, 4. Iob</hi> 31. 31. then you act for Chriſt, and rule for Chriſt; and it is a real demonſtration that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived your authority and power from him. But now on the contrary, if you receive your authority and power from the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and act againſt the Saints, it is manifeſt, that you have not received your power from Chriſt. Which will the better appear, if you conſider the manner of your reception of <hi>power,</hi> and Satans way of conveying power to men; which I find conſtantly recorded in Scripture, to be either by force and violence, quite contrary to Chriſts Method, or by ſlye and ſubtil inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuatious and ſpecious pretences, or by both. And thus you ſhall find that all Tyrants have, by this way, arrived to the height of their power. <hi>Nimrod</hi> a mighty hunter <hi>vi &amp; armis</hi> by the length of his Sword graſped the power into his hand, and erected a Kingdom and Government, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own mind, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 8, 9, 10. In like manner the four great Monarchs threw out their predeceſſours, by the power of the Sword. And as they obtain their Kingdom by force, ſo alſo by flatteries, fair promiſes, proteſtations and the like, as did that vile perſon, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 21. which I conceive to be <hi>Nero,</hi> that cruel Tyrant, who by fair and ſly inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations to his Militia, gained their aſſiſtance to obtain the Kingdom; which being once gotten, he then ſhewed himſelf a moſt bloudy Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Saints. I might inſtance in the Kings of theſe Nations alſo, and all the ten Kingdoms of the Empire, or hornes of the great Beaſt, how they have obtained their power by force of Armes. So did Baſtard-<hi>William</hi> the Conquerour the head of the Succeeding Princes. And <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 12. compared with <hi>Chapt.</hi> 13. 2.) that they all of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their authority, (<hi>viz.</hi> civil power) from the <hi>Dragon,</hi> the Divel. Indeed that power and authority, which the Parliament put forth, as the repreſentative of the Nation, in rooting up the race of thoſe Tyrants, was derived to them in Chriſts way, not in the <hi>Dragons</hi> way. They did not obtain their places by the Sword, but were called thereunto by the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage and vote of the people of God. For though the Saints might be the leſſer number of votes in point of Election, yet they were the better part, and by their inſtant prayers, and Chiefly by the interceſſion of Chriſt, it pleaſed God to order the Election ſo, as ſuch men were choſen for that ſervice, as ſhould carry the work on effectually. And they took not up arms till they were forced for their own juſt defence. And indeed, to take up armes for repreſſing an uſurping Tyrant, is not an offenſive, but defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive war. Yea, were it to curb and reſtrain a Lawful Ruler, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to Tyrannize, it hath been approved of God, as in the caſe of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah:</hi> Much more when like <hi>Athaliah</hi> they aſpire to Government, and cut down Parliaments, or whatever ſtands in the way of their ambition, as ſhe cut off all the Kings Seed; or at leaſt indeavoured the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But 2. Let higher powers conſider, how they act, and for whom: For ſuppoſe they had received their power and authority in Chriſts own way,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:117430:25"/> (which yet may not be acknowledged; becauſe <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, they had it from the <hi>Dragon</hi>) yet if they take the <hi>Dragons</hi> part, and caſt out floods of perſecution againſt the Saints, and brow-beat them, and ſhut them up in Priſons, renting aſunder all relations, The Huſhand from the Wife; deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſo much liberty, as to Miniſter one to another (a curſed and Divelliſh Tyranny) putting them aſunder whom God hath coupled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; Renting alſo the Shepherd from the flock, and murthering the Souls of ſuch perſons (as far as in them lyes) for whom Chriſt hath ſhed his moſt precious blood; then let ſuch powers know, that the authority they exerciſe, it is not from Chriſt, but from the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and rightly called Antichriſtian. Ah! what a gloomy black day will it be to ſuch Rulers, when Chriſt ſhall ſend his Sergeant or Meſſenger, (<hi>Conſcience</hi>) to arreſt them, and ſhut them up cloſe Priſoners, for impriſoning his Servants, and ſhew them the hand-writing upon the Wall, <hi>MENE, MENE, TEKEL UPHARSIN, God hath numbred thy Kingdom, and finiſhed it; thou art weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Balances, and ſound too light, and thy Kingdom is divided,</hi> and given to others. How will their countenance, their ſplendor, be changed, and the bindings of their loynes looſed; and their knees ſmite one againſt another, and all their Lords ſtand aſtoniſhed! Then will not all their Court Chaplains, the Aſtrologers and the Sooth-ſayers be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them. And then if they ſend for <hi>Daniel,</hi> he will read a moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full doom upon them. It were good therefore for ſuch Perſecutors of the Saints, to beware what they do. Let them remember what <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal. 50. 16. What haſt thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that thou ſhouldeſt take my Covenant into thy mouth? Seeing thou hateſt inſtruction, and caſteſt my Words behind thee. When thou ſaweſt a Thief, then thou conſentedſt with him, and haſt thy portion with adulterers. Thou giveſt thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit. Thou ſitteſt and ſpeakeſt againſt thy Brother; Thou ſlandereſt thine own Mothers Son. Theſe things thou haſt done, and I kept ſilence: thou thoughteſt that I was altogether ſuch a one as thy ſelf: but I will reprove thee, and ſet them in order before thine eyes. Now conſider this, ye that forget God, leſt I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</hi> It were better to give God glory; For, whoſoever offereth praiſe to God, and confeſſeth his ſin, gloryfieth me: and to him that diſpoſeth his way aright, I will ſhew the Salvation of God.</p>

                  <p>But to ſpeak more particularly to the Objection, I anſwer; 1. That Saints may; yea, they ought to diſcover the corruptions of all <hi>Image-Governments,</hi> and the righteouſneſs of Chriſts Government, that they may convince the World, and ſpecially Rulers, of their ſin, in not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting themſelves to the quiet, peaceable and righteous Government of Chriſt; and for ſo doing, Rulers may not puniſh them. Yea, they may reprove the evil of Rulers, and denounce Gods Judgments againſt them, and againſt the State, as <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremy, Ezechiel, Jehu, Oded, Amos</hi> and other of the Prophets, yea, Chriſt himſelf; and yet they are not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted diſturbers of the State, nor may they be puniſhed as ſuch. For the Lord forbids it, <hi>Pſal. 105. 15. Touch not mine anointed, do my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets no harm.</hi> 2. I anſwer, that we read not of any godly Prince that fell foul upon the Servants of Chriſt upon this account, but <hi>Aſa;</hi> and he payed dear for it. For God ſmote him with an incurable diſeaſe. 3. I Anſwer, that ſundry wicked Rulers, yea heathens, have had ſo much patience, that they would ſuffer the Servants of Chriſt to deliver their Meſſage, and to rebuke the evils of their perſons and Government, and to make particular applications to them; and yet have not charged them as diſturbers of the State, or ill-affected to the preſent Government, much leſſe have they impriſoned them, and detained them in durance, for ſo doing. <hi>Jehu</hi> threatned <hi>Baaſha,</hi> to take away his poſterity, and the poſterity of his houſe, and that the Dogs and fowls ſhould deavour them, 1 <hi>King. 16. 3, 4.

Exod. 21. 25, 26. Amos</hi> tells <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> he ſhould dye by the Sword, and Iſrael ſhould be carried Captive out of their Land, <hi>Amos 7. 11. Micah</hi> chargeth the Princes of Iſrael, to hate the good, and love the evil, to pluck off the skin from the fleſh, and break their bones, and chop them as for the pot, <hi>Mich. 3. 2, 3. Zephany,</hi> who lived in <hi>Joſiahs</hi> time, charged the Princes, to be like roaring Lions, and her judges Wolves of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that gnaw not the bones till the morning, <hi>Zeph. 3. 3. Jonah</hi> preacheth againſt <hi>Nineveh,</hi> that they ſhould be deſtroyed in fourty dayes: Yet none of theſe were arreſted, as diſturbers of the State, and caſt into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for all their plainneſs. And what can any of the Saints ſay more, then hath been ſpoken by theſe Prophets before them?</p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:117430:26"/>
                  <p>Wherefore unleſs Rulers will declare and publiſh to all the World, that they are acted by the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and that with more malignity, then many wicked, yea, ſome heathen Rulers have been, and that their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is indeed none other, but <hi>Image-Government,</hi> by the terribleneſs of their viſage; it would become them to forbear ſuch hard uſage of Chriſts Meſſengers, who in very faithfulneſs, dare not but deliver their Meſſage, though it be ſomewhat harſh and unpleaſant: Yea, let their callings be ſuppoſed to be never ſo good, yet undoubtedly ſuch kind of exerciſe of their power, is Antichriſtian and Satanical.</p>
                  <p>Therefore if Princes would not hear reproofs, from the Servants of Chriſt, for <hi>mal-administration</hi> of their power, the beſt way is to reform the errours of their Government, and then the Saints will have no occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to blame them. Otherwiſe it is in vain to impriſon them; for the Word of God is not bound. And if they ſhould proceed not only to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon, but condemn them, it would prove but like the cutting off of <hi>Hydra's</hi> head.

And therefore when you ſee Governments <hi>face about,</hi> then know that Chriſts <hi>Government</hi> and Kingdome is not yet come. But when you ſee them face about a pace, as it is in the text, then know that Chriſt is at hand, whoſe right it is. For <hi>Judicial power</hi> (of which the Prophet ſpeaketh) cannot reſt, till it reſt upon Chriſts ſhoulder. It is like a ſtone, that falling from on high, tends to its center; and the neerer it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, it is carried with the more vehemency; even ſo it is in this caſe. Therefore as our Savour ſaith; <hi>When theſe things begin to come to paſſe, then look up, and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth neer,</hi> Luke 21. 28. <hi>For the Rod (or Scepter) of the wicked ſhall not reſt upon the Lot of juſtifyed

For, for you ſakes (ſaith Chriſt) I ſent to <hi>Babel,</hi> and fetched it down: Even ſo<note place="margin">Iſai. 43. 14.</note> will the Lord deal with myſtical <hi>Babel,</hi> and all her Supporters. For your ſakes he will pull them down. The blood and the impriſonments of his Servants, make a loud cry in Chriſts ears, <hi>Rev. 6. 10. How long, O Lord! Holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?</hi> This is the cry of the blood of thoſe that have been ſlain for Chriſt, and for his cauſe. But ſuppoſe you only ſuffer impriſonment for the Teſtimony of Jeſus your Lord and King, will he not regard to relieve you? Yea, verily. He is tender of your liberties, though men be not.</p>
                  <p>He would have men that have power in their hands, to ſet open the Priſon doors; and takes it ill if they do not: but if they will not, either he will do it himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146. 7. or he will be a fellow-Priſoner with you, and you ſhall have his Company for your comfort, <hi>Mat. 25. 43.

But ah, and alas! for the ſad doom and deſtinie of thoſe catchpoles, thoſe falſe Accuſers and Witneſſes againſt the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Chriſt <hi>will deliver up their Children to the famine,</hi> they may go a begging: And themſelves come to an untively death; <hi>he will pour them forth upon the edge of the Sword.</hi> And their wives ſhall be deprived both of Children and Husbands, and their Servants put to death, or ſlain by the Sword in War. Poor incouragement for ſuch men to ſerve ſuch Maſters! And that which may add to your Comfort, and terrour of ſuch <hi>Accuſers,</hi> is, That great acclamation which will be in Heaven, when ſuch falſe Accuſers, are thrown down, as from a ſteep place or <hi>praecipice,</hi> Rev. 12. 10. <hi>And I heard a lowd voyce, ſaying in Heaven; Now is come Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſtrength, and the Kingdom of our God, and the power of his Chriſt:</hi> Why? What is the matter that all Heaven rings with the noiſe of it? The Apoſtle gives anſwer? <hi>For the Accuſer of our Brethren is caſt down, which accuſed them before our God day and night.</hi> I conceive the meaning is, that Satan by his inſtruments, did accuſe them before the Churches and before the civil Magiſtrates, (both which are Gods tribunals:) for neither doth God afford him nor yet his inſtruments, any other preſence of his, where they may prefer ſuch accuſations. And when 'tis ſaid, <hi>I heard a loud voyce ſaying in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. It argues that there is certain and ſpeedy intelligence carried to Heaven, of Occurrences and tranſactions here. Not that God hath any ſuch need of intelligence, but the Saints and Angels in Heaven have need of ſuch intelligences, that they may know the better how to make their applications unto Chriſt for their fellow-brethren, and for the ruine of the implacable enemies of the Churches. And what is the ground of theſe Accuſers ruine? The Reaſon is, Chriſt reigns.</p>
                  <p>But what if they do not only ſmite you with the tongue, but alſo caſt you into Priſon? And what if they keep you in priſon for many months and years, (which is an <hi>Egyptian and Romiſh</hi> cuſtome) and never call you forth to a Legal tryal, nor releaſe you? Yet you may with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſing in Priſon, and be more merry in your hearts, then all your Preſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and ſleep more quietly. And rejoyce for this; that though you may impriſoned, the Word of God cannot be impriſoned, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9. Nay, they have not ſo much power as to impriſon your Spirits. Thank Chriſt for this.</p>
                  <p>It may be the occaſion pretended for your impriſonments, is, that you are not <hi>Caeſars</hi> friends, or diſcontented perſons, and diſaffected to the State, ſuch as would turn the World upſide down; for ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were accounted, becauſe they preached one <hi>King Jeſus,</hi> Act. 17.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:117430:27"/> 6, 7. If this be, the caſe; yet you may rejoyce that your ſufferings are or <hi>King Jeſus,</hi> and that you have no worſe conſorts then <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas.</hi> And I dare be bold to ſay of them, they had neither Swords nor Piſtols about them, (ſaving the Sword of the Spirit) nor never had any hand in any plot or inſurrection againſt <hi>Caeſar.</hi> And bleſſed be God that hath kept his Servants, in all the great Commotions and plottings againſt the Peace of the State, that they have never had their hands in any of them all, but have conſtantly born witneſs againſt the ſame. Ah! what a comfort is it to Chriſts ſuffering Servants, that <hi>they have the Teſtimony of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that in ſimplicity and Godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of God, they have had their converſation in the World,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 12. It is not for Blaſphemy, or murther, or whoring, or ranting, or the like; but for a good conſcience, and for preaching of <hi>Kings Jeſus.</hi> Bleſſe his name for that, and know Chriſt reigneth.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe you have been content to forgo many outward comforts for Chriſt, and many worldly pleaſures and preferments? yet be comfortable, for you ſhall receive an hundred fold, with perſecution; That is, when you are rent and torn away by violent perſecution, and hurried from one place to another, as the word ſignifyeth, for the ſake of Chriſt, then ſhall you receive an hundred for one, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 29, 30.

It is a choiſe example, and worthy due conſideration. But why doth the Apoſtle couple theſe two together, <hi>To be called the Son of</hi> Pharaohs <hi>Daughter,</hi> and, <hi>the pleaſures of ſin?</hi> Are courtly honours the pleaſures of ſin? Or had it been (in it ſelf) a ſin for <hi>Moſes,</hi> to have been called the Son of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> Daughter? For mine own part, I do not think it had been ſimply a ſin, for <hi>Moſes</hi> to have been ſo reputed. But yet, to have accepted ſuch an honour in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, and his brethren to be in ſlavery to the luſt of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> would have been a ſin in <hi>Moſes,</hi> and therefore he refuſed it. For though <hi>Moſes</hi> had outlived <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and had come to the Crown of <hi>Aegypt</hi> after <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and when he had ſat at the ſterne might have eaſed his brethrens burdens; yet his brethren ſtill lay ſubject and expoſed to the Tyranny of ſuch as might ſucceed, and therefore he judged it a ſin to accept ſuch an honour. Beſides, <hi>Moſes</hi> knowing well the guiſe of the Court, and ſinful pleaſures which Courtiers were drowned in, might juſtly ſuſpect the danger and hazard, which he would be expoſed unto, if he had accepted thereof. He knew it would be a hard matter to touch pitch, and not to be defyled with it. And in that reſpect alſo, might decline thoſe flattering pleaſures of the Court, and prefer the afflictions of the people of God, before them. And what did <hi>Moſes</hi> loſe by all this? Or rather, what did he gain by it? He forſook the honour of being reputed <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter, and if he had been ſo accounted, it may be a queſtion whether he ſhould have outlived <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> And if he had, yet it might be a further queſtion, whether he ſhould have attained the Crown. But by denying himſelf in this uncertain hope of honour, Chriſt advanceth him unto true honour indeed, and made him the Deliverer of his brethren, and King in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:117430:28"/> 
                     <hi>Jeſhurun,</hi> Deut. 33. 5. He loſt nothing by his ſelf-denyal, and forſaking the honours of the Court. Indeed when Chriſt ſhall come to reign in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, you may attend the Court then without danger: There you ſhall ſee nothing, but <hi>Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> upon the Horſe-bridles, and upon<note place="margin">Zach. 14. 21.</note> the cups, and upon every cup in Jeruſalem.

                  <p>But to conclude, let this comfort your hearts, that the Lord Jeſus will ſhortly appear in his Kingdom, <hi>Rev. 22. 7, 12.

How did <hi>David</hi> know that? Or by what ſign ſhall we know that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth? For, (ſaith he) <hi>thy Servants take pleaſure in her ſtones, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the duſt thereof.</hi> When this cometh to paſſe, therefore, that Chriſt puts it into the hearts of his people to look for and pray for it, and they pray much for grace unto the ancient people of God the Jews, then you may conclude (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) the ſeaſon and the time appointed is now at hand. This ſign he gave for our ſakes, according as you have it, <hi>verſ. 18. This ſhall be written for the generation to come: that the people which ſhall be created may praiſe the Lord.</hi> And as the context ſeems to hold it forth, the impriſonments and ſufferings of the Saints, who hope and wait for this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt, is an other argument of the neer approach of the time. For ſaith he in the words following; Chriſt looks from Heaven, and hears the ſighings of his Priſoners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And truly it ſeems to me, to argue ſtrongly, that Chriſt is nigh, even at the doors. For 'tis not many years ago, ſince Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> Mr. <hi>Archer,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tho. Goodwin,</hi> might preach of this fifth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and no offence was taken at it: beauſe it was then a little more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote. But now, it is matter of offence or ſcorn, to ſpeak of ſuch a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And what ſhould be the reaſon of the difference? The truth is the ſame then, and now. But the imminent approach of the time, and the publication of it, doth now terrifie carnal Spirits, that would ſtill wallow themſelves in ſenſual pleaſures and pomp, which they think the Holineſs of Chriſts Kingdom will not allow. Theſe fears are like the hornets, which God ſent amongſt the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> and it may be, thoſe hornets were the fears that did poſſeſſe the Spirits of the enemy, and operated more to their ruine, then the Swords of the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> Wherefore <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, even the two Kings of the</hi> Amorites, <hi>not with thy Sword, nor with thy Bow,</hi> Joſh. 24. 12. So then, lay all theſe reaſons together, and they ſtrongly argue the neer approach of Chriſts Kingdom, and the deliverance of his Priſoners. And let this be a comfort to Chriſts ſuffering Saints, that his HIGHNESS, doth look from
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:117430:28"/> the Highneſs of his Sanctuary, to take ſpeciall notice, (from his high proſpect) of poor Priſoners for his cauſe. You have his HIGHNESS eye, and his HIGHNESS ear: Why then ſhould you not be cheary? I ſhall add but one argument more of Chriſts day approaching, and that is, the ſtrong oppoſition which <hi>Satan</hi> makes againſt it, as if he were now come to the puſh of pike, being loath to loſe his Kingdom. And for<note place="margin">

                     </note> this cauſe he is called <hi>Satan,</hi> a malitious accuſer and oppoſer, as the word ſignifies (and you may read it ſo uſed, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 4. 6.) Now the God of Peace ſhall bruiſe Satan under your feet ſhortly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 20. Therefore when the old Serpent begins to work after this manner, and to ſend forth a company of pick-thanks and hirelings to raiſe up malicious accuſations in Emperours and Princes Courts, it is a ſign his Kingdom begins to ſhake, and then Chriſt will bruiſe him ſhortly.</p>
                  <p>Let this ſuffice to be ſpoken by way of comfort and incouragement unto Chriſts ſuffering Servants. I know not whom this may concern, nor into what hands it may come; I am not acquainted with the varieties of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which the Servants of Chriſt meet withall, and therefore draw my Bow at adventures, and leave it to the guidance of the good Spirit of the Lord to direct my Words aright unto ſuch as are concerned therein. I have only picked here and there, ſome ſweet ſmelling flowers, to preſent the ſufferers for Chriſt withall; You may take them as a Noſe gay, to refreſh and cheer you Spirits in the places of your ſufferings. For though you have received a full portion of the Heavenly <hi>

Accept it as an expreſſion of my love to you for the ſake of Chriſt, for whom you ſuffer. Who knoweth, but ſuch a poor preſent, bedewed with love, and dipped in the blood of the Lamb, may yeild much ſpiritual refreſhing, though it proceed from a mean hands? And the Lord that comforts <hi>Sion,</hi> comfort your hearts with many ſweet embraces of his love, and fill you with joy unſpeakable and full of glory. And the Spirit of God and of glory, reſt upon you that are reproached and ſuffer for his Name. <hi>Amen.</hi>
